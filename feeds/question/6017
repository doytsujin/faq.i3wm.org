I am using i3 and I have installed  skippy-xd
It is cool expose manager.
I hope anyone know the analog or the way to configure skippy-xd so it shows windows sorted by workspaces.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 20:43:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6017/make-skippy-xd-to-sort-windows-by-workspaces/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;hello,&lt;/p&gt;

That isn't to say the information can't be retrieved â€“ it can, via the IPC. It's just a non-standard way, so any tool that doesn't specifically support i3's IPC won't be able to do this.

That being said, please don't randomly open new threads. There's no reason you couldn't have asked this [in the other one](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6015/how-to-make-a-workspaces-preview/).  </description><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 20:57:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6017/make-skippy-xd-to-sort-windows-by-workspaces/?answer=6018#post-id-6018</guid></item></channel></rss>
