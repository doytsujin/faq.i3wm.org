You'll have to look how (and if) a default browser is set for your distribution. Also applications of specific desktop environments (KDE, Gnome, Xfce) will most likely use whatever is set with the respective configuration tool.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 11:41:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3708/how-do-i-create-an-alias-in-i3/?comment=3719#comment-3719</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I have created a shortcut for starting chrome in root. but when i issue a command that opens a browser it gives me the usual "google chrome cannot be run as root". so what im wondering is can i create an alias so that anytime linux tries to run "chrome" it runs my command instead?&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3708/how-do-i-create-an-alias-in-i3/?answer=3722#post-id-3722</link><description>There are two ways to accomplish this.

The first is a shell alias that you can configure from your shell rc file, such as `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` which are useful to add default options or shorten commands you commonly use.

    alias off="xset dpms force off"
    alias xclip="xclip -selection clipboard"
    alias dtrx="dtrx --one=here --noninteractive"

For anything more complicated, add a `bin` directory to your home folder and put it in the front of your PATH. The scripts here will override anything that comes later. Also in your shell rc file:

    export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

The fact that you ask this question, and the wording that you choose, seem like you are lacking some of that understanding. </description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 10:26:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3708/how-do-i-create-an-alias-in-i3/?comment=3717#comment-3717</guid></item></channel></rss>
