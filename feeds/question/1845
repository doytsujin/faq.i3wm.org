In HUD you can just use your keyboard to smartly find this menu-entry of gimp... that's what I want and I think this fits to the philosophy of every tiling window manager....</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 09:18:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1845/make-hud-work-together-with-i3/?comment=1870#comment-1870</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Scrabz for &lt;p&gt;Is there any way to make HUD (from unity) to work together with i3?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1845/make-hud-work-together-with-i3/?answer=1895#post-id-1895</link><description>I can't upvote as I'm new, but I registered to say that I would like this too.

My scenario is simply the use of Alt to produce the Unity HUD, which flattens the list of menu and sub-menu items in the currently activated application. This is basically then filtered by the search term and selectable, which activates that menu option within the application.

Example: Sublime Text 2, hit Alt in Unity, the HUD appears, start typing "sing" and the menus are all filtered and the matching sub-menu item is "View &gt; Layout &gt; Single Column" which saved ALT, V &gt; L and the use of ^ and v to navigate and then Enter to select. It also saves having to remember the sub-menus that contain the option you want.

To me... this is to make application alt options act identically to the i3 dmenu. It would be consistent, and a really nice improvement.

I'd rather not actually have it extend the Unity HUD, but to be some standalone thing that any distro could use.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2013 09:01:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1845/make-hud-work-together-with-i3/?answer=1895#post-id-1895</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;I can't upvote as I'm new, but I registered to say that I would like this too.&lt;/p&gt;
