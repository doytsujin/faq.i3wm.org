 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4850/why-is-there-no-split-tabbedstacked/?answer=6379#post-id-6379</link><description> Searching through the [discussion mailing list](http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/) and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues) I could not find any instance where this was even discussed. And the only other related question on this FAQ (that I could find) [was resolved the same way you do](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/169/how-do-i-start-a-new-program-tabbed-or-stacked/?answer=170#post-id-170). 

So, the reason, why this is not implemented, is probably just that no one felt it was really needed. Especially as there is an easy workaround. 

If you you are not satisfied with the workaround, you  can always [open a feature request](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/new) or maybe even program the feature yourself. If nothing else, you will probably at least get an answer why it is not or will not be implemented.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 08:53:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4850/why-is-there-no-split-tabbedstacked/?answer=6379#post-id-6379</guid></item><item><title>Answer by adam for &lt;p&gt;In the i3 documentation I find the commands &lt;code&gt;split horizontal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;split vertical&lt;/code&gt;, which will create a branch in the container tree with horizontally or vertically split subcontainers.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4850/why-is-there-no-split-tabbedstacked/?answer=4851#post-id-4851</link><description>Stacked and tabbed containers are best not used nested, but as parents of single windows or horizontally/vertically split containers. Trust me, nesting a bunch of stacked or tabbed containers within parents is a recipe for tedium. It's harder to navigate within the layout and harder to break the layout down once there are windows you no longer need open (you may find yourself rearranging windows more frequently than necessary). If you want a group of stacked or tabbed windows on one side and a series of splits on the other, create two separate containers at the same level instead of nesting them together.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2014 17:57:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4850/why-is-there-no-split-tabbedstacked/?answer=4851#post-id-4851</guid></item></channel></rss>
