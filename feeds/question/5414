So I figured, I'd find out what's even in the tree.

I ran `i3-msg -t 'get_tree'` once without dmenu and then once when dmenu was open via `sleep 3 &amp;&amp; …`. Comparing both dumps, they are exactly the same right down to the last byte.

How is that? Shouldn't dmenu be a (floating?) window? Why does i3 not see it, but compton still renders a shadow?</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 09:42:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5414/where-is-dmenu-in-the-tree/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to exclude dmenu from compton shadows, but haven't had much luck so far.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5414/where-is-dmenu-in-the-tree/?comment=5418#comment-5418</link><description>That makes sense – I don't know why I didn't think about that. I guess I'll have to use X tools to find out why compton doesn't seem to find dmenu.
