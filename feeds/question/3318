According to [the specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html), this order is maintained: `$HOME/.icons` (for backwards compatibility), in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons` and in `/usr/share/pixmaps`. Here, folder names are themes. the `hicolor`-theme is the fallback theme.
