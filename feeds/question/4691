I'd love to use the stacked windows all the time but unfortunately with certain programs you have to use floating windows i.e gimp
One thing I can't figure out is how do I get the floating windows to stack under a separate container or at least behave in such a way that when I open another window the floating windows remain under the newly opened one.
Or when I try and call(point the mouse or alt+arrow) a stacked window from under the floating windows it comes above the floating ones rather than staying below.
When the window is active I can't see waht I'm doing on it as the floating windows are covering it. 

I know I can switch to another desktop but is there another solution?

Thak you

As far as I can tell, clicking on a window is the only way to bring a window to the front and also the only way to control layering at all.

But, if your main issue is with *gimp*, there are two possible solutions

1. *Single-Window mode*: If you click on *Windows*-&gt;*Single-Window mode* in the main menu, all toolboxes are ordered around the image as toolbars in the same window and multiple images are kept in tabs.

2. Make toolbars normal windows: In the preferences (*Edit*-&gt;*Preferences*) in section *Window Managment* set *Hint for docks and toolbox* to *Normal window*. Now toolboxes are just normal windows and *i3* opens them on the tiling layer by default.
