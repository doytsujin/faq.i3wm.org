I would like to start all my gvim instances in stacking mode. I tried this but without any luck:

    for_window [class="^Gvim$"] layout stacking

How to do that? But I would like also to start one instance in non-stacking mode (in my autostart script). In this case and once I get it working, I will need to do this I guess:

    gvim
    i3-msg layout normal

Right? Thanks!</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2012 14:20:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/430/start-in-stacking/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I will try HEAD first I guess.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2012 15:17:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/430/start-in-stacking/?comment=432#comment-432</guid></item></channel></rss>
