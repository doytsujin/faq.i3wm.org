In any case, the faq is not a good place to debug this sort of problem. Please either file an issue or come to our IRC channel/mailing list.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 08:42:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5652/status_command-error-exit1-when-adding-an-i3statusconf/?comment=5665#comment-5665</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I desperately try to set up my own i3status.conf but somehow it always says status_comman process exited unexpectedly (exit 1) as soon as I add an .i3status.conf in my home directory.
