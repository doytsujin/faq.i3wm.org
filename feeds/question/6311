 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6311/applets-missing/?answer=6312#post-id-6312</link><description>What is likely to be missing is the **system tray**. In your config file, in the i3bar configuration section (`bar { ... }`), search for the `tray_output` directive. This directive specifies if the system tray should be displayed and on what output.

You may want to experiment a little bit. In particular you can try the following if you find a directive

 - `tray_output none`: Try deleting it.
 - `tray_output primary`: Make sure the current screen is primary by running `xrandr --output &lt;output&gt; --primary`, where `&lt;output&gt;` is your current output. 
 - `tray_output &lt;output&gt;`, where `&lt;output&gt;` is not your current output: Modify it to your current output.

More information can be found in the i3 User's Guide in [Section 5.8. Tray Output](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_tray_output).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 04:47:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6311/applets-missing/?answer=6312#post-id-6312</guid></item><item><title>Comment by nielsk for &lt;p&gt;What is likely to be missing is the &lt;strong&gt;system tray&lt;/strong&gt;.
