When you got to the extreme right your mouse cursor is on the border of the window, which does not actually belong to the application itself. 

Aside from just not moving to the right, disabling the window borders might be the simplest solution. Fortunately *i3* provides a feature to disable just the borders on the edge of the screen while keeping borders between windows.

Just set

    hide_edge_borders vertical

in your `~/.i3/config` and reload your configuration (for example by running `i3-msg reload` if you do not have it mapped to a key). Now scrolling should work even if you move to the very right (plus, you gain a few pixels in window width).
