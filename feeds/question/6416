Also, as the second question was off-topic, I removed it. The answer is to use `command` in order to use the binary not the other alias: `alias l='command ls -hlsZ --color=auto` and `alias ls=`command ls -ahlsZ --color=auto`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2015 07:50:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6416/bindsym-q-physlock-d-sudo-systemctl-hibernate-does-not-work/?comment=6418#comment-6418</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm very new to Linux and I'm not sure why "physlock -d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl hibernate" is not working (session will lock, but it will not hibernate).

Allow passwordless hibernate and then it should work, providing physlock forks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2015 06:35:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6416/bindsym-q-physlock-d-sudo-systemctl-hibernate-does-not-work/?comment=6417#comment-6417</guid></item></channel></rss>
