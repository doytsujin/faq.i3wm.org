I've noticed that any of the applications which are started by i3, but not making use of the tray area are unaffected, as you'd expect.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 23:31:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4102/restart-inplace-kills-tray-applications-started-by-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;When I perform an inplace restart of i3, usually to take advantage of new configuration, or occasionally because of an upgrade to a new version of i3, any applications which run in the tray area of i3bar die.&lt;/p&gt;

For me it's happening on one machine but not on others (running the same i3 version and the same config files). I have so far failed to find the cause.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 12:56:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4102/restart-inplace-kills-tray-applications-started-by-i3/?comment=4175#comment-4175</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;When I perform an inplace restart of i3, usually to take advantage of new configuration, or occasionally because of an upgrade to a new version of i3, any applications which run in the tray area of i3bar die.&lt;/p&gt;
