I'm a new user of i3 and I have some problems.
I use i3 on a VM machine on a mac (VMWare fusion). I installed the last version of Ubuntu (12.10).

I have some problem with the encoding of the character. I'm French, and when some words which are written with accent are displayed, the accent character is replace by "??"

I try to change the font of i3 with this line : font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
but nothing changed .... 

At the beginning i didn't have that problem, but as i have some problem with gdm (my lancher), i try to reinstall it or replace him by slim, and at the end go back to gdm because the problem with bigger with slim. But when i was back to i3, the encoding had changed :/ maybe I have to change something in the Ubuntu settings but i don't know how to do that (I already tried to launch Mod+d : gsettings).</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 19:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1185/encoding-accent-character/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Personally, I set up my locales in `~/.xsession` like this:

    unset LC_ALL
    export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
    export LC_MESSAGES=C
    export LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8

[Edit] Note that you need to chose “Custom” as session type in your login manager (e.g. GDM) so that the .xsession file gets executed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 10:17:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1185/encoding-accent-character/?answer=1194#post-id-1194</guid></item><item><title>Comment by MonsieurJc for &lt;p&gt;It seems like your locale environment variables are not configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
