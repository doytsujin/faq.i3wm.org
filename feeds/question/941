For the record, I use gnome-terminal, and one of its conveniences is to access copy with ctrl+shift+c and paste with ctrl+shift+v.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 10:22:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/941/how-to-copy-paste-from-browser-to-terminal/?answer=942#post-id-942</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Haps for &lt;p&gt;I guess controlling copy and paste is not up to the window manager, so you will have to handle clipboard with the terminal you are using. &lt;/p&gt;

As a matter of fact I had read up on this very thing not even four hours ago. I'm not sure if the default is left and right buttons simultaneously for a middle click; if it is it was set by the OS at installation time - xorg is pretty un-intuitive considering installation and configuration scenarios.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 14:53:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/941/how-to-copy-paste-from-browser-to-terminal/?answer=5374#post-id-5374</guid></item></channel></rss>
