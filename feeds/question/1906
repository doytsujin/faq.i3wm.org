Has anyone found a way to configure i3 (or Chrome) to handle this like other windows?</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 01:16:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1906/google-chrome-fullscreen-handled-by-browser-and-not-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;When I try to fullscreen Google Chrome by with &lt;code&gt;meta+f&lt;/code&gt;, it's handled by Chrome and not i3.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1906/google-chrome-fullscreen-handled-by-browser-and-not-i3/?answer=1924#post-id-1924</link><description>1. Has anybody found a solution to this?

2. My solution so far is to just use keyboard shortcuts (vimperator)&lt;br/&gt;
I mapped the following keys&lt;br/&gt;
, to previousTab&lt;br/&gt;
. to nextTab&lt;br/&gt;
&lt; to goBack&lt;br/&gt;
\&gt; to goForward&lt;br/&gt;
seemed easier to press than Shift+[HJKL]&lt;br/&gt;

I find 'o' pretty cool to open a searchbar. That's basically the stuff I need to do in fullscreen browser.

But you can disable this behavior in Firefox in `about:config` by toggling the flag `browser.fullscreen.autohide`. Not sure about Chrome, though. </description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 05:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1906/google-chrome-fullscreen-handled-by-browser-and-not-i3/?answer=1907#post-id-1907</guid></item><item><title>Comment by kzrl for &lt;p&gt;It is the same for Firefox.

Between your answer and Bruno's, it put me on the right track to finding a solution.

An example of this happening is gEdit, which provides its own fullscreen feature but does not match to what happens when you issue fullscreen in i3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 05:21:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1906/google-chrome-fullscreen-handled-by-browser-and-not-i3/?answer=1908#post-id-1908</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ncraike for &lt;p&gt;I haven't checked the i3 source, but I believe that i3 will issue a fullscreen request to the application if available, that is why it works differently on Chrome and firefox... if the application does not provide this feature, i3 will just maximize the window without title and borders.
