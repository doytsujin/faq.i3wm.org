I use version 4.6. Is there any output if you just run `i3status --config ~/.i3status.conf` from shell?</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2013 18:53:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3139/i3status-not-displaying-anything-on-i3bar/?comment=3140#comment-3140</guid></item><item><title>Answer by DatGuyWithDahProblemYahFimme for &lt;p&gt;After installing i3, I decided that I should try and configure i3status and i3bar to display a 12 hour clock, so I read the user guide and i3status manpage and followed all of the directions.

I didn't have i3status installed. I thought it was part of the base package. After I installed it was working.
