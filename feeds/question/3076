This is kind of annoying for example when opening dmenu over i3bar and there you get a noticable worse font rendering, although it's of course the same Xft-font and the same size.

Is there anything I can do to improve i3's font rendering?</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2013 15:01:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3076/bad-xft-rendering-in-i3i3bar/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by idrei for &lt;p&gt;When using Xft-fonts in i3, the font rendering is worse than in other applications like dmenu for example.

The quality of the stock rendering varies by distro. On Arch, it is particularly bad on a fresh install.

A detailed article on how to adjust the font settings can be found on the [Font Configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration) article on the Arch Wiki.

I highly recommend using the [Infinality](http://www.infinality.net/blog/) freetype patchset. It is easy to use and dramatically improves font rendering right away. It works well with the `ttf-liberation` package, chromeos fonts, TeX Live, or MS Fonts.

For a good monospace font to use for the i3 interface, I recommend Fira Mono (`ttf-fira-mono`) or DejaVu Sans Mono (`ttf-dejavu`).</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 03:27:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3076/bad-xft-rendering-in-i3i3bar/?answer=3078#post-id-3078</guid></item><item><title>Comment by idrei for &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, i3 will as of now not use your Xft settings to render those fonts.
