Is there a way to do this?

Lets say I have a vertical or horizontal container that occupies half the screen. This container contains a browser window and a terminal window. Now when I go full-screen, say with the browser, (mod+f), the browser window expands to fill the entire screen obscuring the other containers and windows. I guess what I'm looking for is a mode where if I go full-container with the browser, then the browser window will expand to fill only its parent container. I hope this is clearer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 19:56:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself wanting to full screen windows to the container.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/?answer=2398#post-id-2398</link><description>Perhaps temporarily enter tab mode (by default mod+w) then return to whatever mode the container was in previously (probably mod+e) when done. Note assuming that the window in question is a direct child of the container in question you would perform that operation after highlighting the window itself, not the container. (ie select what is to be the tab, not the container that is to be tabbed).</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 14:17:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/?answer=2398#post-id-2398</guid></item><item><title>Answer by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself wanting to full screen windows to the container.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/?answer=3365#post-id-3365</link><description>Here is something I came up with for this purpose that I have in my config.

    bindsym $mod+$mod2+f focus parent; fullscreen; focus child

Note that if the parent container is a workspace, it won't do anything because workspaces cannot be fullscreen. In that case, a normal fullscreen command will do.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 17:56:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/?answer=3365#post-id-3365</guid></item><item><title>Answer by paz for &lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself wanting to full screen windows to the container.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2242/full-screen-to-container/?answer=3356#post-id-3356</link><description>Hey,

I also needed a way to "fullscreen" a window to a container and I was able to figure out a (dirty) workaround.

You can use Xephyr to create a nested Xserver.

$ Xephyr :1 -ac -screen 460x340 &amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp;  

$ DISPLAY=:1 firefox --fullscreen www.google.at
