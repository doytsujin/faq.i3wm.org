I have been testing i3 in a VM.  Previously, I was using Ubuntu, but I've been gravitating towards Mint.  (I dont *always* use i3, and I like Cinnamon better than Gnome/Unity).

The problem I'm having is similar to this:  (search "rid nautilus desktop window" on this site:  sorry, not enough karma to post links...)  when I launch Nemo (instead of nautilus), there is also a desktop window spawned.  The proposed fix for the gnome desktop worked for me.

I'm wondering, does anyone know what I might do with Cinnamon?  I have tried:  `gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false` but it did not work.  I'm afraid i just do not know nearly enough about Cinnamon's package structure or the commands one can send to it to know what to do.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2013 02:19:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3083/nemo-launches-a-desktop-window-linux-mint-16-cinnamon/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by AinSoph for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
