I know about i3-dmenu-desktop, but that's not really what I want. If I know the name of the program that I want to start, then I don't need more than dmenu. But if I don't know exactly what a program was called, or if I want to browse what's installed, then a one-row command completion isn't very helpful either.

Basically, I'm looking for something that shows the freedesktop menu like gnome-panel or xfce-panel do -- but without implementing a persistent panel.  I just want a program that I can run (from dmenu), that shows me the menu (in hierachical form in a multi-line window), and that terminates after I've clicked on a menu entry or close the window.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 05:05:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5413/program-to-browse-freedesktop-menu/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Ruben G for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know program for interactive browsing of the freedesktop menu (and nothing more)?&lt;/p&gt;

I've found this nice app for the traybar:
(Sorry I don't have enough karma to publish direct links).
`github.com/trizen/menutray`

Found in this related reddit thread with instructions for Debian/Ubuntu:
`www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/2qa1wj/menutray_a_dropdown_application_launcher_that`

Working like a charm! Only icons aren't showing, but I don't really care..

PD. Finally I filled a github's issue for the icons thing, developer was a very nice guy, issue solved.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 19:19:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5413/program-to-browse-freedesktop-menu/?answer=5558#post-id-5558</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lasers for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know program for interactive browsing of the freedesktop menu (and nothing more)?&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5413/program-to-browse-freedesktop-menu/?answer=5423#post-id-5423</link><description>I use xfce4-panel. You can customize theme/size to make it small and hopefully less noticeable. Several xfce4-popup-* items have --pointer option that allows you to popup menu at current mouse position.

For popup items to work, you need to run 'xfce4-panel --disable-wm-check' and add the items to the panel -- then bindsym your favorite items (such as xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu -p or xfce4-popup-whiskermenu -p)

I tried lot of things, lot of launchers and even a simple ncurses XDG menu -- https://github.com/XayOn/cursedXDG -- and they all does not fare well for me.

My opinion right now is that xfce4-panel or mate-panel seems like the the best way to get your XDG menu.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 11:26:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5413/program-to-browse-freedesktop-menu/?answer=5423#post-id-5423</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know program for interactive browsing of the freedesktop menu (and nothing more)?&lt;/p&gt;

Now, if only it'd use different colors for menu entries and submenus, and would not wait for any started application to exit.. guess I'll have to do some hacking.
