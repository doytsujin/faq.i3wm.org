Is it possible to configure i3 such that new started applications in fullscreen mode come to front automatically? Is it possible to configure this behaviour only for some specific applications (for example gmrun)?

This is for example the case in xmonad. </description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 12:26:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1540/move-new-window-automatically-to-front-in-fullscreen-mode/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;When I am in fullscreen mode and start a new application via dmenu or using a keyboard shortcut it doesn't appear.

Without some hackery with the IPC you cannot make this happen. There is no way for i3 to know with what intention (if at all) the window has been created. If you are into writing scripts, you could easily test if the current active workspace is in fullscreen mode, and disable fullscreen mode if necessary before you start your new window. </description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 19:45:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1540/move-new-window-automatically-to-front-in-fullscreen-mode/?answer=1547#post-id-1547</guid></item></channel></rss>
