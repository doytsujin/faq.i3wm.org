And pretty hard to implement in a way that doesn't seem confusing, IMHO.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2015 12:20:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6083/hide-tiled-window/?comment=6085#comment-6085</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;is it possible to have a (non-terminal) guake-style window that is tiled but can be hidden and shown again, restoring its original position?

And it'd be pretty tough to implement. For floating windows, you don't need to care about the position because it's independent from all other windows. For tiled containers, however, you need to remember the position within the tree and the size ratio. While this is somewhat doable as long as the tree stays the same, it becomes an extremely complex issue once the tree changes. Of course you can *make* it easy by using a naive approach, but that will likely cause more confusion than do good. </description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 05:57:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6083/hide-tiled-window/?answer=6094#post-id-6094</guid></item><item><title>Comment by parras for &lt;p&gt;Posting as an answer now: No, i3 does not offer anything like that.

My main use case is for keeping windows at the edges of the screen so perhaps a naive approach could work for me. The easiest thing I can think of would be to call `[window] move left` say 20 times and assume you won't have any more than 20 windows.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2015 22:38:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6083/hide-tiled-window/?comment=7478#comment-7478</guid></item></channel></rss>
