You are just probably missing something being started as a part of Gnome session.</description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2013 16:01:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1897/sound-does-not-work/?comment=1943#comment-1943</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;I've installed i3wm on a fresh Ubuntu 13.04 installation, and I just can't hear anything.

Have you tried playing with '**alsamixer**'? Just enter it in a terminal. It helped me multiple times when I had sound problems on my eeePc.

You can also test the speakers with '**speaker-test**'.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 07:54:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1897/sound-does-not-work/?answer=1913#post-id-1913</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Darkwater for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Putting it up fixed the problem.</description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2013 16:03:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1897/sound-does-not-work/?comment=1944#comment-1944</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cowsquad for &lt;p&gt;I've installed i3wm on a fresh Ubuntu 13.04 installation, and I just can't hear anything.
