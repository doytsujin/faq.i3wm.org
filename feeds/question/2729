I'd love to get some input into how to mess with RANDR or something to provide virtual outputs that are mapped to a physical outputs screen range.

Why?  Because I often have very wide monitors.. and I'm really looking into a DisplayPort joiner that offers 3840x1200 resolution spanned over multiple monitors.  X will have no idea it's in use or that there is anything other than a rather large monitor.

I'm not interested in using Xdmx in order to make this 'work'.

Core goal is not to have identical support to xinerama hints or the like.. it's more to have the window manager be able to map ranges outside of xinerama to workspaces.

In the long run I can see how a 2/3 size workspace shared with two smaller workspaces off to one side might be ideal for some high resolution systems.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 17:49:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2729/sub-output-support-50-on-left-50-on-right/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Mike for &lt;p&gt;This seems tricky of course.. but it would be wonderful to be able to do things like FakeXinerama was able to do with previous Xorgs.

I experimented with it when I had a monitor with 3840x1200, to the right of my laptop of 1920x1080, using this line in my .i3/config
