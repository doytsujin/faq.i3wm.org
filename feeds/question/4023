When I put that window back into floating the size is the original, not the one I resized. This appears to be the default behaviour. 

So is it possible to configure a window which was in float and then resized, to remember the floating geometry when changing layouts?</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 10:14:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4023/remember-floating-size/</guid></item></channel></rss>
