 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6126/how-do-i-start-i3/?answer=6128#post-id-6128</link><description>Assuming no other window manager / desktop envrionment is running: if you just start "i3" from the TTY, it will tell you that it cannot open the display because the X server is not yet running.

The easiest way to get started is to edit (or create, if misisng) `~/.xinitrc`. If it didn't exist, simply put `exec i3` in there. If it exists, check the bottom for some `exec` call, comment it out and put `exec i3` instead.

Once the file is saved, run `startx` from the TTY. This will start an X server, read the file and then start i3. </description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2015 08:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6126/how-do-i-start-i3/?answer=6128#post-id-6128</guid></item><item><title>Comment by QBWR for &lt;p&gt;Assuming no other window manager / desktop envrionment is running: if you just start "i3" from the TTY, it will tell you that it cannot open the display because the X server is not yet running.&lt;/p&gt;
