Following the instructions here:

(http://i3wm.org/docs/user-contributed/conky-i3bar.html)

I end up with the following error on the i3bar:
`Error:status_command not found or is missing a library dependency (error 127)`

This also happens if I follow other directions (essentially the same as above) I  have found to get conky to display colors in the i3bar.

I have i3status installed but am trying to find what library I could be missing.

Any help, tips, ideas gratefully accepted!</description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 04:44:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4899/status_command-missing-library-exit-127/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by NimS for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

I'm now in the enjoyably frustrating situation of having found a solution but not knowing what the solution was... I tried so many variables without clearly checking each as i went along... But, it works now!</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 12:53:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4899/status_command-missing-library-exit-127/?comment=4910#comment-4910</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

The error message suggests conky is trying to run some background command that isn't installed on your system. And FYI, i3status wouldn't have anything to do with it. It isn't needed for i3bar to work, it's a completely separate program.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 18:59:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4899/status_command-missing-library-exit-127/?comment=4900#comment-4900</guid></item></channel></rss>
