I know i3 can be restarted with a command within i3, but I want to send a command from a terminal to the current i3 session (if at all possible). I want to restart i3 after returning from suspending my computer (the i3 bar freezes after suspending my computer), so I was going to make a systemd script for it.

I was trying to use some kind of ridiculous combination of "i3-input" and "xdotool", which wasn't getting me anywhere, as you can imagine.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2012 23:24:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/783/restart-i3-with-shell-solved/?comment=785#comment-785</guid></item></channel></rss>
