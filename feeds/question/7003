I am trying out i3 currently, and I noticed that the right click menu does not work in thunderbird. I use the application a lot so having it functioning properly is a must. Having rhythmbox's right click menu functioning too would be a bonus. I am hoping that the two issues are related.

As far as I can see the right click menus work in every other application just fine.

Are there any steps I can take to start to debug this issue? I can't even really think where to begin. </description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 00:21:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7003/no-right-click-menu-in-thunderbird-of-rhythmbox/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

How about trying another window manager(s) to see if you run into the same issue in them?</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 03:02:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7003/no-right-click-menu-in-thunderbird-of-rhythmbox/?comment=7004#comment-7004</guid></item></channel></rss>
