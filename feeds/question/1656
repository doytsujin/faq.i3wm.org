You could go for a 'toggle Modifier-key to config file; reload i3'-hotkey on your host. But, assuming you are using ssh to do the X-work, I would have a look at the `--compression` option to ssh, and, on a trusted network, fiddle around with types of encryption. </description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 21:19:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1656/how-can-i-pass-meta-key-presses-to-a-nested-instance-of-i3/?answer=1666#post-id-1666</guid></item><item><title>Comment by stsquad for &lt;p&gt;Dont think it is possible to do this in a 'nice' way. &lt;/p&gt;

However there doesn't seem to be much documentation other than the resize mode example in the User guide. For one how do I unbind all the existing keys while in the mode?</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2013 23:43:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1656/how-can-i-pass-meta-key-presses-to-a-nested-instance-of-i3/?comment=1691#comment-1691</guid></item><item><title>Comment by vandannen for &lt;p&gt;Couldn't you just define some kind of pass-through mode in the local i3 instance, which has no keybinding defined except, e.g., escape for switching back to default mode?&lt;/p&gt;

Exisiting keybinding are unbound by default when switching to a mode. So you just need to define the bindings you would like to have. I gave an example for a similar situation here: https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1679/toggle-i3s-listening-behavior/?answer=1681#post-id-1681</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 12:15:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1656/how-can-i-pass-meta-key-presses-to-a-nested-instance-of-i3/?comment=1735#comment-1735</guid></item></channel></rss>
