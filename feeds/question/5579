Pay attention to the consistency between 'order' lines and the run_watch definition below.

Bonus: I clean up other statuses that I do not use by commenting the corresponding 'order' lines. 

    # i3status configuration file.
    # see "man i3status" for documentation.
    
    # It is important that this file is edited as UTF-8.
    # The following line should contain a sharp s:
    # ÃŸ
    # If the above line is not correctly displayed, fix your editor first!
    
    general {
            colors = true
            interval = 5 
    }
    
    # order += "ipv6"
    order += "disk /"
    # order += "run_watch DHCP"
    order += "run_watch VPN"
    order += "run_watch Anyconnect"
    order += "wireless wlan0"
    # order += "ethernet eth0"
    # order += "battery 0"
    order += "load"
    order += "tztime local"
    
    wireless wlan0 {
            format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip"
            format_down = "W: down"
    }
    
    ethernet eth0 {
            # if you use %speed, i3status requires root privileges
            format_up = "E: %ip (%speed)"
            format_down = "E: down"
    }
    
    battery 0 { 
            format = "%status %percentage %remaining"
    }
    
    run_watch DHCP {
            pidfile = "/var/run/dhclient*.pid"
    }
    
    run_watch VPN {
            pidfile = "/sys/class/net/tun0/dev_id"
    }
    
    run_watch Anyconnect {
            pidfile = "/var/run/vpnagentd.pid"
            }   
    
    tztime local {
            format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
    }
    
    load {
            format = "%1min"
    }
    
    disk "/" {
            format = "%avail"
    }

You then check if this other file exists. I'm attaching a Bash script that does this.

    #!/bin/bash
    MYFILE=/home/username/.i3/vpn
    while true
    do
        if [[ -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vpn0 || -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tun0 ]]
        then
            touch $MYFILE # this creates $MYFILE
        else
            rm -f $MYFILE # this deletes $MYFILE
        fi
        sleep 1 # check every second, modify to run the check at other intervals
    done

Now you have to start the script automatically, which can be achieved by adding this line to the config &lt;code&gt;exec --no-startup-id /home/username/.i3/checkVPN.sh&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;/home/username/.i3/checkVPN.sh&lt;/code&gt; is the script.

In a different approach, I prefer to have two unambiguous separate VPN status reports. I will post the solution in the answer because of limit for number of characters in comments.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 10:29:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5579/how-can-i-check-if-either-of-2-paths-exist-in-vpn-check/?comment=6291#comment-6291</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I use openvpn to connect to one provider and openconnect to another provider.
