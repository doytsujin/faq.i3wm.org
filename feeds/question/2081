I've just installed the i3 window manager on Arch Linux, running from a Virtual Machine (VMWare) on a Windows 7 system. And I can't get the copy/paste working between W7 and i3 on Arch. Copy and Paste works fine between the host and guest when I'm running Xfce, but not for i3. (VMWare-tools are installed.)</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2013 12:38:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2081/copy-and-paste-in-vmware/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Wolven for &lt;p&gt;Hi.

Thank you for your reply.

I've got the official VMware tools installed on the system and not the Open-VM-Tools, so I do not have the "vmware-user-suid-wrapper" command as described in the docs.

I might give the Open-VM-Tools a try to see of it makes a difference, but as stated in the first post. Copy and Paste works fine between the host and guest OS when I'm using Xfce as DE.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2013 11:34:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2081/copy-and-paste-in-vmware/?answer=2090#post-id-2090</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

It will lead to a hint. Be sure to answer your own question ;) Good luck!</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2013 19:51:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2081/copy-and-paste-in-vmware/?comment=2093#comment-2093</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi.
