I'm happy using i3 as my wm.   Lately I have set $mod+F1 to fire firefox and assign firefox to workspace 3 in my config file.  It is working fine.

But once I move the firefox from workspace3 to other workspaces, let's say workspace 5, whatever pop up from firefox, the popup windows would go back to workspace 3.

I know it is not really a bug or something, just want to let you know and see what I can do to keep the popup in the same workspace.

Thanks.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 14:33:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/697/same-applications-showing-on-the-same-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
