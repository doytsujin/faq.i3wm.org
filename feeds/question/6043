I am so used to bash's stemming rules that dmenu trips me up. The manpage says " Tab    Copy the selected item to the input field.", but I want it to instead do prefix-matching, especially in that it should fill in the maximum number of characters shared by all matches.  Is there some wrapper script or something that can trick it into doing this?</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 22:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6043/dmenu-tab-completion/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Is there any way to get dmenu's tab-completion to behave like bash?

Unless there is some fork of dmenu out there for this, I think this isn't possible. Either way, dmenu isn't an i3 product, so maybe you should also ask this in other places.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 05:19:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6043/dmenu-tab-completion/?comment=6047#comment-6047</guid></item></channel></rss>
