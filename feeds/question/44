 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/44/email-notification-in-i3/?answer=45#post-id-45</link><description>I started this discussion on the mailing list some time ago ([here](http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/2012-March/000572.html)), and here is a brief:

a) If you are using an email client: thunderbird or claws-mail will do the trick for you (with tray icon properly displayed as well)

b) If you are only using browser email client, such as Gmail, check out checkgmail.

Update 2013-07-25:

for option (b), checkgmail is basically crashing (project looks dead), so I am dropping it in favor of manually handling this on the i3status directly. You can use conky or add to the i3bar using pipe. I created a script, based on conky solutions for Gmail, it is available here: [gmail-count](https://gist.github.com/brunobraga/6076658) (comments, suggestions, welcome).</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2012 01:01:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/44/email-notification-in-i3/?answer=45#post-id-45</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;I started this discussion on the mailing list some time ago (&lt;a href="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/2012-March/000572.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and here is a brief:&lt;/p&gt;

It does have a few options, but it basically just works.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2012 06:55:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/44/email-notification-in-i3/?answer=53#post-id-53</guid></item><item><title>Answer by miguel for &lt;p&gt;Can anyone tell about good email notification tools working on i3wm?&lt;/p&gt;
 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/44/email-notification-in-i3/?answer=55#post-id-55</link><description>If you use mutt with the `set beep_new` setting, it is possible to activate the urgency hint in xterm or urxvt by adding the following lines to the `~/.Xresources` configuration file:

    XTerm*bellIsUrgent: true
    URxvt*urgentOnBell: true

Then the color of the window decoration will change according to the `client.urgent` colorclass and the workspace button color defined by `urgent_workspace` (see [changing colors](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_colors) and [workspace colors](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_colors) in the userguide),
when the window is out of focus. This would also work when the beep from the PC speaker is disabled.
