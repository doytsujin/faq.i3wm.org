Is there a possibility to spawn a new desktop for each opened window except floats? 

Note that I do not want to add a line to the config file for each program I could possibly want to start potentially, just a new desktop for each. Else I just could use section 4.12. from the users guide.

This seems just such an generic solution in the battle for screen real estate that I think I've overlooked something. In that I case will be thankfull for a pointer to the correct answer.

Thanks in advance!

They provide no extra information I need, and eat up a part of my screen space. With the solution I'm looking for, I can still choose to use them, but I've usually opened 2-6 windows, an I can remember easily which desktop holds each program.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2014 15:02:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5254/open-new-windows-on-new-workspaces/?comment=5262#comment-5262</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm just inept to search properly, but I can't find an answer for the life of me.&lt;/p&gt;

Note that you need to replace the `workspace` command with a script that opens a new workspace. Such a command is not in i3 because the behavior is very specific to the user’s needs — which output should the workspace be created on, what should be its name…?

In case you don’t, the IPC interface may still be good enough: you could look for new window events and then move these windows to a new workspace. See http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html for more information.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:58:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5254/open-new-windows-on-new-workspaces/?answer=5273#post-id-5273</guid></item></channel></rss>
