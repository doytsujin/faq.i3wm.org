What I want to prevent is having to set the number manually.

Check **6.5.1. Named workspaces**
If you dislike number prefix, you can [strip them](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_strip_workspace_numbers)</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 12:06:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6516/automatically-map-named-workspaces-to-numbers/?answer=6566#post-id-6566</guid></item><item><title>Answer by languitar for &lt;p&gt;I am using named workspaces most of the time.
