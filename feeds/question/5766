The problem is that whenever I'm working on a vim full-sized window which has a vertical split, upon starting and quitting this terminal, the vim's window split bar will be placed where the terminal border was and not where the split bar was.

I also have "set equalalways" on vimrc.

Is there a way of preventing this situation?

    autocmd VimResized * wincmd =

in your `~/.vimrc`.

Explanation:
------------

Not *i3*, but *vim* itself moves the split bar. When the window containing *vim* is shrunk, *vim* will move split bars, so that all split bars and at least one column of every (*vim* internal) window are still visible. When the window is grown, *vim* will not move the split bars back. This is independent of `equalalways`, which works only when creating new splits or closing (*vim* internal) windows, but not when resizing the surrounding window.

You can manually equalize the vim splits with **CTRL-W_=** or `set noea ea`

The above setting waits for the resize event and calls **CTRL-W_=** for you, equalizing splits each time the window is resized.
