I know I could just modify those lines. But I prefer to have just one version of the file that is universal across computers and here's why:

  - it could be tracked with a version-control system, so
  - I could keep improving it and simply pulling the changes from a VCS server,
  - it would be easily adaptable to any new platform.

C preprocessor provides macros and `#ifdef`s, bash programmers can use environment variables and `if`s.
