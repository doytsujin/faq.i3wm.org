The placeholder mechanism is too weak. Even without x2go, I would want my terminals to end up at the same place, i.e. I close the window and I open them again. That should be supported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 08:58:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4415/keep-placeholder-alive-when-application-exists/?comment=5718#comment-5718</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Niklas for &lt;p&gt;I'm using saved layouts, but some programs reopen their windows when changing their settings or even when starting.&lt;/p&gt;

My usual setup are some terminals with logs and automatic testing suites (guard). From time to time, these have to be restarted or they just crash out $REASON. It would be nice when I could restart them on my side and i3 would put it in its old place</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2015 17:57:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4415/keep-placeholder-alive-when-application-exists/?comment=5433#comment-5433</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I'm using saved layouts, but some programs reopen their windows when changing their settings or even when starting.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4415/keep-placeholder-alive-when-application-exists/?comment=4432#comment-4432</link><description>Steam is a lost cause, since it seems to manage windows internally. Users of floating WMs won't notice anything odd, but several tilers have problems with it: Tooltips grabbing focus, pop-ups moving on their own, poor window sizing, etc. It uses stupid fading effects too, even without compositing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 14:21:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4415/keep-placeholder-alive-when-application-exists/?comment=4432#comment-4432</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I'm using saved layouts, but some programs reopen their windows when changing their settings or even when starting.&lt;/p&gt;
