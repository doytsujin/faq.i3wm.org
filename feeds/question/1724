 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1724/custom-keymap-reset-after-resume/?answer=1728#post-id-1728</link><description>My suspicion on why that happens is that your keyboard gets disconnected for a short amount of time and gets recognized as a new device.

One way to work around this effect is to configure your keyboard layout in Xorg.conf, not via Xmodmap:

Another, uglier way, is to chain the i3lock invocation you possibly use for suspending:
