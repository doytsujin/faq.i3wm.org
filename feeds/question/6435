In other words, this window has neither class, nor instance, nor title. I thought this was going to be easy to match with:

    for_window [class="^$" instance="^$" title="^$"] floating enable

but it turns out this doesn't match. If I remove the `title` component, the window is matched (so I guess a window without title is different from a window with an empty title), but merely matching for empty class and instance also applies to a number of other windows (that I don't want to be floating).

What is the best way to match this window?

I've put the i3-dump-log output when the window appears on http://pastebin.com/CWxbnEns.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 16:59:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6435/how-to-match-window-without-title/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to work around missing window manager hints in Matlab windows using the &lt;code&gt;for_window&lt;/code&gt; directive, but I'm running into some problems.

It's a shame they want to keep this secret. It's a shame they keep any bug secret, really.
