I use Selenium to test a web application and while testing is annoying because it opens a lot of windows in my current workspace, if I configure Firefox to open in other workspace with i3, the Firefox dialogues also goes to that workspace which is annoying too, any ideas?</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 05:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5816/firefox-default-workspace-and-dialogs/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by i3convert for &lt;p&gt;Any way to set new Firefox windows in a defined workspace letting the dialogues open in the current one?&lt;/p&gt;
