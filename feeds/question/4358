bindsym $mod-Shift+1 move conatiner to output DVI-0  
   # will move to workspace that is showing on DVI-0

bindsym $mod-Shift+1 move conatiner to workspace 2: misc
#moves to workspace 2 on a single monitor setup

but what if I want to move the active container on VGA-0 to workspace 2 on DVI-0 ?

Near as I can tell that chain can't be broken.  That shouldn't be a problem though, because workspaces are unique. Once a workspace is created on a particular monitor a workspace of the same name can't exist anywhere else. So you'd just need to assign specific workspaces to specific monitors, then create keybindings to move windows to specific workspaces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:30:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4358/move-a-windowcontainer-to-a-specific-workspace-on-a-specific-output/?answer=4359#post-id-4359</guid></item></channel></rss>
