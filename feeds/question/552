is there a way to step through the programs of a tabbed container without raising every window to the top when it is focused?

For example, if I have two tabbed containers side by side, each holding 3 programs. How can I activate the middle program in both containers without using my mouse?
(Maybe there is even a more direct way than stepping through all windows for raising one of them?)

Thanks,
Richard

    focus parent
    focus right

The first one will focus the tabbed container itself, the second one will move focus to the right, thus focusing the other tabbed container. Since focus descends, the middle window will be focused in the end.

These commands are bound to Mod+a, Mod+Right by default.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 09:01:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/552/leaving-a-window-nested-in-a-tabbed-container-without-loosing-focus/?answer=553#post-id-553</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Richard for &lt;p&gt;You can use the following sequence of commands:&lt;/p&gt;
