It can be triggered, i mean, but the actual _fullscreen_ size remains the same with the smaller one, which is the primary screen.

I wonder if this is some stuff with i3wm, or firefox just cannot recognise the second screen size.</description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2014 15:02:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3275/firefox-video-cannot-trigger-fullscreen-in-another-screen/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I found the video fullscreen on another bigger screen with firefox cannot be triggered. &lt;/p&gt;

But this clearly is a bug report, not a question. Please post it at bugs.i3wm.org instead.</description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2014 15:15:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3275/firefox-video-cannot-trigger-fullscreen-in-another-screen/?comment=3276#comment-3276</guid></item></channel></rss>
