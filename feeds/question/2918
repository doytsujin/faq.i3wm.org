i3 does have the `exec` command for starting applications, so you could just bind a shortcut for any program you wish to start often. 

    bindsym Mod4+p exec program

If you really want buttons to click, you need additional tools, like the Xfce panel.</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2013 16:56:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2918/application-launchers/?answer=2919#post-id-2919</guid></item><item><title>Comment by emq for &lt;p&gt;i3 itself does not provide anything like, neither for the bar nor as additional tool. i3 is intended to be used mainly by keyboard, so mouse driven application launchers do not really fit the design. &lt;/p&gt;
