Pointer interactions are limited to focusing and resizing windows, or moving floating windows. By contrast, touchscreen interfaces were taken into account in the designs of both Unity and GNOME Shell.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 16:38:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4764/how-can-i-get-multitouch-to-work-with-i3/?comment=4776#comment-4776</guid></item><item><title>Comment by richardkemp for &lt;p&gt;I have a laptop with a multitouch touch screen (a Lenovo Yoga 2), and I'd love to get multitouch working with i3.

Tiling WMs and touchscreens follow two different, arguably mutually exclusive human interface design paradigms. Anything you might be able to get working with Touchegg in i3 could almost certainly be done faster and easier with a keyboard.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4764/how-can-i-get-multitouch-to-work-with-i3/?comment=4817#comment-4817</guid></item></channel></rss>
