In my conky config, I set:

    alignment bottom_middle
    own_window yes
    own_window_class Conky
    own_window_type panel
    out_to_console no
    out_to_stderr no

Conky's man page says:

&gt; Panel windows reserve space along a desktop edge, just like panels and taskbars, preventing maximized windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on the alignment option.

The [i3 User's Guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) says:

&gt; Regardless of which application you use to display the status line, you want to make sure that it registers as a dock window using EWMH hints. i3 will position the window either at the top or at the bottom of the screen, depending on which hint the application sets. With i3bar, you can configure its position, see [i3bar_position].

No matter what alignment I use, it sticks to the top of the screen. I would like to have conky at the bottom of my screen (which worked fine with gnome-panel).

Here is the output of xprop for conky:

    _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL(CARDINAL) = 0, 0, 0, 84, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1920, 3840
    _NET_WM_STRUT(CARDINAL) = 0, 0, 0, 84
    XKLAVIER_STATE(INTEGER) = 0, 0
    WM_STATE(WM_STATE):
    		window state: Normal
    		icon window: 0x0
    _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK
    WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  
    WM_NAME(STRING) = "Conky (ecliptic)"
    WM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = "en_US.UTF-8"
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Conky", "Conky"
    WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
    		Client accepts input or input focus: True
    		Initial state is Don't Care State.
    WM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = "ecliptic"
    WM_COMMAND(STRING) = { "conky", "-c", "/home/mike/.i3/conky1", "-a", "bottom_right" }

And here's the xprop output for the i3bar (correctly at the bottom of the screen):

    XKLAVIER_STATE(INTEGER) = 0, 0
    WM_STATE(WM_STATE):
    		window state: Normal
    		icon window: 0x0
    _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL(CARDINAL) = 0, 0, 0, 23, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1920
    _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK
    WM_NAME(STRING) = "i3bar for output DP-2"
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "i3bar", "i3bar"

Am I doing something wrong, is it a bug in conky, is it a bug in i3, or something else?

Is there a way I can force conky to dock to the bottom of the screen?</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2012 03:24:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/952/how-to-align-conky-panel-to-bottom-of-screen-instead-of-top/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I just started using &lt;a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/"&gt;conky&lt;/a&gt; (with its own window so I can display graphs), and I want it to dock at the bottom of the screen instead of the top.&lt;/p&gt;

It sets its `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE` to `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK`, but only after actually mapping the window (= making it visual) it adds the `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` property.

Fixing this in conky is probably straight-forward and lots of people will be thankful, so please go ahead ;-).</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 19:04:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/952/how-to-align-conky-panel-to-bottom-of-screen-instead-of-top/?answer=964#post-id-964</guid></item></channel></rss>
