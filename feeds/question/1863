I am pretty new to i3 and like it so far very much.
Just switched my main working laptop from XFCE (with Compiz) to i3 (actually still XFCE, but with i3 as window manager).

What I miss is my [Rainlendar Calendar](http://rainlendar.net) on the desktop.

Is it possible to have it shown on all desktops but beneath all other windows?

Any help is welcome.&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you in advance.&lt;br/&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br/&gt;

An application either has a window, or it does not exist. If you could tell rainlendar to launch without integrating in the desktop, I would look into `scratchpad`. If not, you're out of luck. </description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 04:16:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1863/use-rainlendar-on-i3-desktop/?answer=1867#post-id-1867</guid></item></channel></rss>
