While those two have their own key bindings to release the keyboard and the mouse cursor (CTRL+ALT for QEMU and CTRL+F10 for dosbox), I came across another application for which I could not find such bindings. It's the OgreSampleBrowser. Is there a way to prevent a random application to grab all my input? Or is there at least a way that i3 still reacts to its key bindings?

I suggest you file a bug report against the broken application.  </description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2015 21:29:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6076/dont-let-applications-grab-full-keyboard-input/?answer=6079#post-id-6079</guid></item></channel></rss>
