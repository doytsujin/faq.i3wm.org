Not sure this is the same as answered elsewhere where --no-startup-id is used.  Is there a global way to disable the wait cursor- I find it distracting when I launch the menu is I don't use the mouse much and it sort of pops out.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 20:40:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5420/wait-cursor-remains-after-dismissing-menu/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dan for &lt;p&gt;Press Mod+D to summon the program menu.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5420/wait-cursor-remains-after-dismissing-menu/?answer=5421#post-id-5421</link><description>Yes, this is the same behavior. dmenu itself is not startup-id aware, but that’s okay for the case where an application is started, because the application itself will tell i3 when it’s ready.

When you do not start an application, nobody tells i3 that the startup process is done, so you’ll see the wait cursor until it times out (after 1 minute).

There is no global switch, as this feature really should work and the applications should be fixed to be made startup-id aware. Therefore, we don’t want to encourage turning off a useful feature.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 21:04:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5420/wait-cursor-remains-after-dismissing-menu/?answer=5421#post-id-5421</guid></item></channel></rss>
