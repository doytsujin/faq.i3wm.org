I then start it up with "xinit i3" which utilizes a script almost identicalt to the one seen here on the Arch wiki(xinitrc#Making_a_DE.2FWM_choice). It starts up okay, with the cursor remaining as a clock for over a minute. I don't know if this is normal or not, though I assume it is abnormal for my computer not to recognise any input at all. I couldn't move the mouse, nor could I ctrl+alt+F2 into another TTY. I tried unplugging my keyboard and mouse, but that didn't work. At some point I accidentally hit the power button which initiated a reboot. This reboot was handled by the OS as opposed to a simple power cycling.

Why is this happening, and how do I fix it?</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 00:12:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4763/no-keyboard-nor-mouse-input-on-initial-start/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I installed i3 from the Arch main repo with "pacman -S i3".

If so, please consider [opening a bug](newticket.i3wm.org), as the FAQ is not the right place for that. If not, then the issue is probably with your Xorg configuration and not *i3*.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 06:11:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4763/no-keyboard-nor-mouse-input-on-initial-start/?comment=4765#comment-4765</guid></item></channel></rss>
