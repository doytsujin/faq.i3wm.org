Allow me to clarify what I mean.  I have my monitors arranged as so (DP# just being the DisplayPort-#):

    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | DP1  |     |     |     |
    +------+ DP4 | DP5 | DP1 |
    | DP9  |     |     |     |
    +------+-----+-----+-----+

What I was hoping to do is have a window go fullscreen on DP1, DP4, and DP5.  I realize there is the `fulscreen global` option, but because DP1 and DP9 have a lower PPI than DP1, 4, and 5, there is part of whatever cut off on the top of DP1 and the bottom of DP9.

I realize this is a niche case that very little people (if any) car about, but on the off chance anyone knows, it'd be awesome if you could post the solution.  otherwise I might look into a feature request

This is as close as you can get there is no way to be actually be fullscreen across more than one display but not all of them. </description><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2015 04:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5979/fullscreen-accross-certain-monitors/?answer=5983#post-id-5983</guid></item><item><title>Comment by drak3 for &lt;p&gt;Make a script that floats the current window via i3-msg then uses xdotool to move it to the corner of dp4 and resize it to be the appropriate size to fit across all 3 monitors.  &lt;/p&gt;
