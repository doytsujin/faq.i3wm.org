</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1784/alias-in-keybind-doesnt-work/?comment=1786#comment-1786</link><description>Thanks Badboy,
You're sort of right about the uselessness of using a shortcut in the config, but I thought that, when libreoffice4.1 or libreoffice5.0 should appear, I would just have to change the alias, and not retype the whole name into config. That would certainly save me some seconds ;-)</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2013 20:21:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1784/alias-in-keybind-doesnt-work/?comment=1786#comment-1786</guid></item><item><title>Comment by badboy_ for &lt;p&gt;aliases are only evaluated in an interactive shell, &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; does not use such a shell.
