After installing i3, I added i3 to my xinitrc file and ran startx. The i3 window
manager loads, but the i3bar doesn't.  Instead I see "Error: status_command process exited unexpectedly (exit 1)".  I am fairly sure the issue is with my i3status.conf file.  When I comment out the the line "status_command i3status" in my /.i3/config file the error goes away.  The problem is, I have no clue what is wrong with the file.  It's the default generated one and would assume it should work.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

I tried using dzen2 instead of i3bar but when I installed it and tried to start it from terminal I would receive the error "dzen: locale not available, expect problems with fonts."

Turns out when I initially setup Arch, I hadn't enabled my locale.  I had already edited my locale.gen file but never ran the command locale-gen to update the system.  After doing so my i3bar started working!</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2014 19:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3509/installing-and-configuring-i3-on-arch/?answer=3510#post-id-3510</guid></item></channel></rss>
