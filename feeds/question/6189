I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean with "can only write some characters". When I shutdown or exit the session I don't normally continue to write text, so I think I don't understand what you mean exactly ;)</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 21:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6189/problem-leaving-i3/?comment=6193#comment-6193</guid></item></channel></rss>
