I have noticed a very strange problem today.
When I open a new terminal on a screen I can type like always. Buf if I open another one (or third one) I cannot type there.

It is highlighted and has a courser in it, but nothing happens when i type.

I did not had this for years of using i3wm
Btw, my system is an Arch Linux.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 19:07:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2146/cant-type-in-more-than-one-terminal-on-screen/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

Which i3? Happens also with other terminal emulator? You touched any of the config files recently? </description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 07:59:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2146/cant-type-in-more-than-one-terminal-on-screen/?comment=2150#comment-2150</guid></item><item><title>Answer by xaoc for &lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

I am using xterm, bash, i3 version 4.5.1
I did not touch any config files in the last days (except some grub stuff a week ago)

tty works, so it looks like a windows manager/ terminal emulator problem
I tried urxvt and it works, so maybe its a xterm bug?

(btw I use true transparency)</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 08:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2146/cant-type-in-more-than-one-terminal-on-screen/?answer=2151#post-id-2151</guid></item><item><title>Answer by xaoc for &lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually xterm releases updates once every 5 years (just joking ;) ), now we have 2 updates in less than a month...</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2013 06:29:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2146/cant-type-in-more-than-one-terminal-on-screen/?comment=2153#comment-2153</guid></item></channel></rss>
