Could you please add the relevant output of `sockstat`? Also, a bit of information about your system could help: which distribution, version of *i3* and where from did you get it?</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 19:04:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5155/why-does-i3status-need-to-listen-for-udp-connections/?comment=5157#comment-5157</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have used sockstat to check my opened ports and services which were using them and I have noticed i3status is listening for udp connections.

In my machine (FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE amd64) there is a listening socket:

Output of sockstat:

&lt;pre&gt;
  $ sockstat -4 | grep i3status

    user i3status   966   3  udp4   *:*                   *:*

&lt;/pre&gt;


and the output of fstat (lsof equivalent):

&lt;pre&gt;
  
 $ fstat -n -p 966 | grep internet

   user i3status     966    3* internet dgram udp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
&lt;/pre&gt;


PS: The **xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx** represents the HW address of the network card.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2014 14:16:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5155/why-does-i3status-need-to-listen-for-udp-connections/?answer=5161#post-id-5161</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have used sockstat to check my opened ports and services which were using them and I have noticed i3status is listening for udp connections.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5155/why-does-i3status-need-to-listen-for-udp-connections/?answer=5159#post-id-5159</link><description>i3status does not open a listening socket:

    sudo netstat -np | grep i3status | wc -l
    0

However, it indeed creates a UDP socket:

    $ sudo lsof -n -p $(pidof i3status) | grep sock
    i3status 26396 michael    3u  sock    0,7       0t0   268864 protocol: UDP

The places in the code where sockets are created are

http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/src/print_ipv6_addr.c?id=3818dabcebea7f98e3dfdfbe5be42374bb60cf88#n24

and

http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/i3status.c?id=3818dabcebea7f98e3dfdfbe5be42374bb60cf88#n542 (which is used in http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/src/print_eth_info.c?id=3818dabcebea7f98e3dfdfbe5be42374bb60cf88#n35)

But as I said, those are not listening sockets, so it shouldnâ€™t pose a security problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 19:33:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5155/why-does-i3status-need-to-listen-for-udp-connections/?answer=5159#post-id-5159</guid></item></channel></rss>
