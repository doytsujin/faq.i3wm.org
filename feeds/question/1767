Here's what I have in my config:

I think it might be because the window title has the current song before it followed by Audacious, so maybe I just need a wildcard character?</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1767/cant-get-for_window-to-work-with-audacious/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by vandannen for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to have Audacious float when opened, however it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

As specified in the [user guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_list_of_commands): "class: Compares the window class (the second part of WM_CLASS)". So, in this case, you need to use capital letters or match case-insensitive:

    for_window [class="Audacious"] floating enable
    or
    for_window [class="(?i)audacious"] floating enable</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 20:05:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1767/cant-get-for_window-to-work-with-audacious/?answer=1770#post-id-1770</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Matthew for &lt;p&gt;Make sure that you match the correct class for the specified program.
