If not, would this be a difficult feature to implement? It doesn't look like it and I'd be willing to implement it myself, but I'm not very familiar with i3's codebase.

If you care about this being implemented, I suggest you first [file a feature request on Github](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues). Even if you were to implement this yourself, you should at least get a reply on whether we'd accept such a feature. Otherwise your work would either be wasted or you'd have to fork i3 for yourself.

The relevant code is probably mostly src/x.c and include/data.h. Plus you'd need to add a command for it, for which I suggest looking at any recent PR that added a new command.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2015 15:52:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6523/dynamically-changing-window-border-colors/?answer=6525#post-id-6525</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;No, this isn't possible at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
