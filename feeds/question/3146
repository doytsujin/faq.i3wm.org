If you would start another program (say urxvt) within your stacked container the title would be something like: "i3: S[Navigator urxvt]".  
You can switch the focus between the different containers within your stacked container with mod+&lt;ARROW_KEYS&gt; (or whatever you have put in your config file).  

There is also the option to make the main container horizontally split or tabbed. The state is displayed in the title with "i3: H[Navigator urxvt]" or "i3: T[Navigator urxvt]" respectively.

I don't know how I did it, but I ended up with 4 navigators navigating my Firefox. I'd rather just have a plain old application window, but I am embarrassed to say the only way I know how to achieve this is to restart Firefox itself :(</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2014 11:45:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3146/a-strange-window-title-like-i3-snavigator/?comment=5266#comment-5266</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;That means that your container has a "stacked layout" (mod+s) and within your container there is one program (Navigator) displayed. &lt;br/&gt;
