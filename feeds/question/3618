Now a block command may return 3 lines. If so, they will be:

  1. the full_text
  2. the short_text
  3. the color

For example, a script setting a full_text in blue but no short_text
would look like:

    echo "Here's my label"
    echo
    echo \#0000FF</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2014 23:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3618/i3blocks-color/?answer=3619#post-id-3619</guid></item></channel></rss>
