Because my laptop have only 13` of screen size I often need to resize some consoles to full screen. Fullscreen mode is not appropriate for me, because I can't navigate to another consoles where I have fullscreen. I want hotkeys to trigger maximization of vertical split to right, left or center.

I know that I can achieve this by "mod+r-&gt; ;;;;;;;" or "mod+r -&gt; jjjjjjjjj" but I want to do it quickly in one or two hotkeys.</description><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2014 10:48:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4501/quickly-resize-splitted-containers-to-full-screen/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I have a tons of consoles and organize it within vertical split both parts of which consists of consoles that stacked on each other.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll have two independent stacked containers. More flexible that way.</description><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2014 20:00:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4501/quickly-resize-splitted-containers-to-full-screen/?comment=4512#comment-4512</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Use "select parent" and toggle the entire container to fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
