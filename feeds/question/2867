Maybe you could post the output from xprop so we could see the difference between a 'normal' firefox' window and a 'private browsing' one. There's a regex for everything as long as the title is distinctive.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 07:17:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2867/how-do-i-make-firefox-open-a-private-browsing-window-on-another-workspace/?comment=2884#comment-2884</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;You could try something like that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At first the title is only 'Mozilla Firefox'. If it works sometimes, it possibly depends on how fast Firefox changes the title (I'm not sure when `assign` grabs the attributes of new windows).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 10:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2867/how-do-i-make-firefox-open-a-private-browsing-window-on-another-workspace/?comment=3215#comment-3215</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;You could try something like that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    assign [title=".*Private.*"] "Firefox Window 4" 

Also, the one Cee provided in your first of three questions about this topic works excellent. 

I suspect you have a directive earlier in your config that matches this window. The first match wins. </description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 07:48:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2867/how-do-i-make-firefox-open-a-private-browsing-window-on-another-workspace/?comment=3200#comment-3200</guid></item><item><title>Comment by paramnesioid for &lt;p&gt;You could try something like that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The workspace bit is not the problem. It does work when I change 'title' to 'id' but then it sends normal Firefox windows there too.
