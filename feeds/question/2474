Today I work like this:
workspaces [1][2][4] are on my primary output and [3][5] on my second
I'm on my first output and go on a new workspace: the [6] now.
I'd like to say to i3 to create this workspace on the fifth workspace and move the others incremented by one.

The resullt would be 

primary: 

[1][2][3][4] second: [5][6]

instead of

primary: [1][2][4][6] second: [3][5]

In order to have a better workspace switcher way without send a workspace to the other screen.

I don't know if I'm very clear but the idea is to have **automatically higher workspace number on second screen than on the primary**

Is this possible today ? In case not I'll write a script and put it on github</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 22:36:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2474/move-workspacelayout-to-another-output-and-follow-them-by-screens/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;I was maybe not very clear in my title.

I don't think it is possible out of the box, but a script using i3-msg should be able to du the job.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 08:44:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2474/move-workspacelayout-to-another-output-and-follow-them-by-screens/?comment=2475#comment-2475</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tinh for &lt;p&gt;I was maybe not very clear in my title.
