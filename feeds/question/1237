Hopefully the cruxt of my answer help the OP. Why or What, not sure, but for whatever the reason, at various times the MOD key is reverted back to ALT, along with all default configs.  When I inline restart again, my config file is once again read. </description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 19:04:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1237/first-time-using-i3-keyboard-shortcuts-stop-working/?comment=1246#comment-1246</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;There have been instances where a change I make, then after a restart seems to confuse i3 into reading the original config in &lt;code&gt;/etc/i3/config&lt;/code&gt; which contains the original MOD key (alt) replaces my configured one (win).

Since version 4.4 of i3, modes are displayed in i3bar. Caps Lock having any effect on key bindings is fixed in git.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 19:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1237/first-time-using-i3-keyboard-shortcuts-stop-working/?answer=1245#post-id-1245</guid></item></channel></rss>
