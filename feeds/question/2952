I believe in i3's tree model, this would mean I have two sibling nodes in my tree, each with many windows in it. However, I can't seem to create a tree like this.

That is because ``layout tabbed|stacking`` works like ``layout splith|splitv``, as opposed to  ``split horizontal|vertical``. That is: It operates on the container, rather than the current window. 

Assuming you have created the windows of the left branch, and have the first and only window in the right branch focused, I would press the ``split horizontal`` shortcut. The result is a new container, which you will see if you open an extra window. 

After the second window is open, you can make this new container tabbed or stacking. 

If this does not answer your question, please update your question. And please describe what you actually **do**. 

**Update** 
Correction. You don't even need to create the second window in the right branch. Just put this in my `i3.conf`:  

    bindsym $mod+Shift+W split v; layout tabbed

This will turn the current window into a tabbed container with only one window. </description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2013 21:25:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2952/how-to-have-two-sibling-nodes-with-many-children-each/?answer=2953#post-id-2953</guid></item><item><title>Comment by efrey for &lt;p&gt;I am taking a guess at what you are actually asking, but I suppose that you are talking about not being able to make a stacking/tabbed container in the right one.

I have only been using the `layout split(h|v)` commands, not the `split horizontal` command. After reading your comments I returned to the manual and found what you are talking about.
