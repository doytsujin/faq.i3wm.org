dmenu_run pointed me to dmenu_path. I found the cache file by stracing dmenu_path. It is ~/.dmenu_cache on my computer. By deleting this it now seems to be recreated correctly.

I guess this was originally run without my .bashrc being parsed, to get my path?</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 22:32:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/792/why-does-dmenu-not-pick-up-an-application/?comment=796#comment-796</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Dunno, possibly the cache is somehow not updated.

If the cache is older than the newest file, the cache will be rewritten. </description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 23:13:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/792/why-does-dmenu-not-pick-up-an-application/?comment=799#comment-799</guid></item></channel></rss>
