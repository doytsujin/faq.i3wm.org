 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5178/disable-dropbox-icon-in-i3status/?answer=5180#post-id-5180</link><description>The tray icons are handled by `i3bar` and have nothing do do with `i3status`. (`i3status`  only creates text status messages).

You can disable **all** tray icons by setting `tray_output none` in the `bar{}` section(s) of your *i3* configuration (see [section "Tray Output" in the User's Guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_tray_output))

    bar {
        tray_output none
    }

If you want to disable just the Dropbox icon there are two ways, that depend on your preferences and are not really *i3* specific:

1. You want Dropbox to run but do not like the icon: This can only be done from within Dropbox settings, see if there is an option for that.
2. You do not care about Dropbox at all: Do not run Dropbox. If it is started from within the *i3* configuration, remove the corresponding `exec` statement. Else you will have to go looking from where it is being started.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2014 08:42:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5178/disable-dropbox-icon-in-i3status/?answer=5180#post-id-5180</guid></item></channel></rss>
