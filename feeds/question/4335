I am using a dual monitor setup and would like to switch focus between whatever there is currently in focus on either screen.

I know that I can use the arrows to move focus left or right, but one could have multiple vertical tabs open on both screens. Changing focus from the leftmost on the left screen to the rightmost on the right screen is a pain.

I know that one can focus the parent and then use the arrows, but this still seems odd.



Update:
Thank you both, Adaephon and konni.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4335/move-focus-to-monitor/?answer=4343#post-id-4343</link><description>The `focus` command can also used for outputs (See [Section 6.4 of the *User's Guide*](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_focusing_moving_containers))

    focus output &lt;&lt;left|right|down|up&gt;|output&gt;

So you can set something like this in your configuration:

    bindsym $mod+Control+Left focus output left
    bindsym $mod+Control+Right focus output right

----

BTW: The same works for the `move` command (Although it seems to be undocumented in the *User's Guide*)

    bindsym $mod+Control+Shift+Left move output left
    bindsym $mod+Control+Shift+Right move output right
