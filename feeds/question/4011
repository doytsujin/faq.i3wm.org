I can advice `parcellite` as clipboard manager -- very useful if you don't remember basicallu nothing like me.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 21:50:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4011/a-list-of-recommended-tray-applets-in-different-distros/?answer=4915#post-id-4915</guid></item><item><title>Answer by farnerup for &lt;p&gt;I am going through the pain of finding sensible tray applets on Fedora 20.

    exec xfce4-power-manager
    exec dropbox start
    exec nm-applet

I also get an ibus applet, although I don't know what is starting it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 13:52:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4011/a-list-of-recommended-tray-applets-in-different-distros/?answer=4902#post-id-4902</guid></item><item><title>Answer by badboy_ for &lt;p&gt;I am going through the pain of finding sensible tray applets on Fedora 20.

Not everyone is using the network-manager, so even nm-applet does not make sense for all.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 11:23:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4011/a-list-of-recommended-tray-applets-in-different-distros/?answer=4012#post-id-4012</guid></item></channel></rss>
