 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4136/setting-container-names/?answer=5795#post-id-5795</link><description>Not an answer, but as a dity workaround, I'm using this:

 1. I create a process with custom name,
 2. start a container,
 3. keep the sleeper as first.

The hack is based on the fact that i3 uses process name--not window title--as item in the list.

For example, when working on a bug 123:

 1. I call my script below as `mkprocn BUG123`, which creates "sleeper" process called
     BUG123 (just as if the executable was called that way),
 2. I create a sub-container, keeping the sleeper as first child
 3. I move all relevant windows there.

I end up with something like `i3: T[BUG123 title1 title2 ...]`.

Disadvantage is that I have to keep the process running, but with tabbed layout this is not much of a deal.

The script (**use at your own risk**).

    #!/bin/bash
    # mkprocn
    
    name="FOO"
    action="__fork__"
    
    usage() {
        echo "usage: $(basename $0) NAME" &gt;&amp;2;
        exit 2
    }
    
    while true; do case "$1" in
        __*__)  action="$1";    break ;;
        "")  break                    ;;
        -*)  usage                    ;;
        *)   name="$1"; shift 1       ;;
    esac done
    
    case "$action" in
        __sleep__)
            sleep 10000000000;
            ;;
        __fork__)
            $0 "$name" __exec__ &amp;
            ;;
        __exec__)
            exec -a "$name" urxvt -title "$name" -e "$0" __sleep__; break ;;
        *)
            usage
            ;;
    esac


You might want to

 *  replace the *urxvt* syntax with some other terminal,
 *  replace `-e "$0" __sleep__` with something useful like `-e vim notes-$name.txt`,
 *  add decorations to the name to make it more visible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 14:29:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4136/setting-container-names/?answer=5795#post-id-5795</guid></item></channel></rss>
