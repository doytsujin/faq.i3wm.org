    bindsym Escape exec xdotool key 66

(66 being the keyCODE for Capslock, maybe check it using xev). Xdotool is available via package management in at least Ubuntu and Arch Linux.</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 12:13:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1496/change-caps-lock-to-esc-in-i3/?answer=1501#post-id-1501</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I don't know a direct i3 solution but you could bind the escape key to xdotool:&lt;/p&gt;
