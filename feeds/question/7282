Next you can make the window floating and resize it.. this results in a floating video frame in front of any other non-floating window.

But that doesn't seem to work for every web video, for instance YouTube refuses to cooperate. It will simply exit fullscreen mode upon pressing `$mod+f` (fullscreen toggle).

How do I reproduce this behaviour for other sites, e.g. YouTube?

To clarify what I mean, I've attached a screenshot:

Making it work for everything involves patching i3. The patch is quite simple, but you will break fullscreen for applications that you actually want to be fullscreened. Then this could of course be made configurable per window and so on, but then you're talking about a bigger patch.

None of this will be merged into i3. It's not how the specification is intended.

That said, I totally abuse this "bug" as well (have been for a while) and Youtube works just fine with it when using Chrome. I even have a keybinding set up for it:

    bindsym $mod+y fullscreen disable; floating enable; resize set 400 300; sticky enable; move window to position 1515 20</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 23:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7282/force-fullscreen-video-to-floating-window/?answer=7284#post-id-7284</guid></item><item><title>Comment by apoc for &lt;p&gt;This isn't supported behavior whatsoever and there's little you can do about it.
