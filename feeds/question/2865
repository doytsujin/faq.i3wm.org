 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2865/is-there-a-way-to-killreset-a-whole-workspace/?answer=2875#post-id-2875</link><description>You can use `focus parent` until all containers are selected (just press and hold the bound key(s) for a second or two) and then `kill`. 

As you can bind multiple commands to a key, you could also do this:

    bindsym $mod+Control+Shift+k focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, focus parent, kill

Add more `focus parent, `, if you are stacking more than ten levels deep.

Note: this may need version 4.7 to work, as previous versions threw error messages when trying to `kill` workspace containers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 19:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2865/is-there-a-way-to-killreset-a-whole-workspace/?answer=2875#post-id-2875</guid></item><item><title>Comment by flylo for &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;focus parent&lt;/code&gt; until all containers are selected (just press and hold the bound key(s) for a second or two) and then &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
