I have had more success putting it in `~/.xinitrc` than in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config`. Then `pavucontrol` will magically work. </description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 15:32:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2419/sound-in-i3-does-not-work/?answer=2438#post-id-2438</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kenou for &lt;p&gt;If using pulseaudio and no sound at all, make &lt;code&gt;start-pulseaudio-x11&lt;/code&gt; is in your startup file.

I infer you can play audio or video and hear things on phones or speakers, and that you want to have your multimedia keys adjust the volume. If so, use 'xev' to get the names of the relevant multimedia keys and use those with the 'bindkey' command; this in turn assumes you know the commands to change volume, try using 'amixer'.

I use 'volti' as my volume control widget, it has an option to use multimedia keys.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2013 22:31:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2419/sound-in-i3-does-not-work/?answer=2422#post-id-2422</guid></item></channel></rss>
