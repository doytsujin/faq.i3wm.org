I sync common dot files via a github repo[1] and a cron job. The fact that they are versioned is also attractive.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/?comment=3514#comment-3514</link><description>I would really like to advocate for adding including of files to i3. Something like being able to have a config.d directory, with small files instead of having this giant blob of text that is hard to share. Unfortunately, my skills with C is not enough to make this happen on my own :-(</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 12:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/?comment=3514#comment-3514</guid></item><item><title>Answer by marc for &lt;p&gt;I am currently managing about 8 computers here and there, all using i3... and I have set of shared files and folders for stuff it can be reused in all (bash_aliases, bashrc, .vim, etc).

Another option would be if/else conditons based on environment variables like $HOSTNAME etc. Creating the config on startup is an option but forces me to recreate the config file every time I made changes and want to reload the config on the fly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2013 23:29:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/?answer=1858#post-id-1858</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have the same problem.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/?answer=1369#post-id-1369</link><description>There is no include mechanism in i3 itself. But you can create the config file everytime X starts from templates.

    #!/bin/bash
    cat $HOME/.config/i3/config.base \
        $HOME/.config/i3/config.local &gt; $HOME/.config/i3/config
    exec /usr/bin/i3

Something like this as a wrapper-script around i3 should work.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2013 01:29:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/?answer=1369#post-id-1369</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;There is no include mechanism in i3 itself.
