However, if I start the process via dmenu (`i3-msg "exec dmenu_run"`, and then type `blabla` into the dmenu prompt), PS1 is set to a mere `\s-\v\$`.

Why is that? I grepped for PS1 in the dmenu sources, but could not find anything.

(When trying to reproduce any of this, make sure to completely terminate your terminal emulator, so that i3-sensible-terminal is actually starting a new terminal and not just telling an existing terminal process to open another window).
