I discovered i3 recently, and found it to be really cool. I installed it on my new ArchLinux pc besides cinnamon/xfce, but there's a pinkish line on the left edge of the screen, which looks like a video glitch. It is not there if I log into cinnamon/xfce. Moreover, if I log into cinnamon/xfce, log out, and login into i3, the line disappears! How can it be fixed?</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2014 11:48:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4667/pink-line-on-left-edge-i3-in-archlinux/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
