Since I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.10 I have a thicker-than-before border around the workspace buttons in my bar (see screenshot below). I've scoured Google, this site and the docs, but I can't figure out how to make it smaller. It used to be just 1 pixel or something, now it's more, and the dividers between the i3status elements are wider as well. This makes the bar take up more vertical screen space than necessary.

Anyone know how to fix this problem? 

My version of i3 is 4.8 (2014-06-15, branch "4.8").

It also seems to screw up the layout in the bar: dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37485661/screwy-layout.png</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 14:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4882/thicker-workspace-button-border-in-i3bar/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

So if you have a screen with a resolution well above the common 96 dpi ("Retina", "Ultra-HD") i3 may use two pixel for these borders instead of one.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 16:10:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4882/thicker-workspace-button-border-in-i3bar/?comment=4884#comment-4884</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Maarten for &lt;p&gt;Hi,
