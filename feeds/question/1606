Their floating popups only partially draw; the bottom right third (approx) is left undrawn in the window.  Resizing the window does not solve the issue: the components redraw and re-layout but still the bottom right third is clipped away and remains whatever was behind.

Even un-pop-uping the window (cmd+shift+space) doesn't fix the issue.

Can anyone help me diagnose and fix this problem? Thanks in advance!
