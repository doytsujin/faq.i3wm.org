 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/29/how-do-you-make-i3-pick-up-resizing-the-vmware-window/?answer=30#post-id-30</link><description>This is due to a bug in the vmware X11 driver. When i3 starts up, XRandR is not available, and thus i3 falls back on not using XRandR. However, after the first change to the configuration (for example by resizing), XRandR becomes available. Thus, the inplace restart has a different setup before and afterwards, and that leads to workspace 1 getting lost.

To workaround this issue, you can issue an xrandr call in your `~/.xsession` file:

    #!/bin/sh
    xrandr
    exec i3</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 20:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/29/how-do-you-make-i3-pick-up-resizing-the-vmware-window/?answer=30#post-id-30</guid></item><item><title>Comment by freb for &lt;p&gt;This is due to a bug in the vmware X11 driver.
