I've been using i3 for a couple of days now and am enjoying it a lot.

What I'd like to do is have it so that when I click the full screen button on an embedded video it fills up the container instead of the entire screen. I'm not sure how to go about doing this so any help/direction would be much appreciated.

Thank you in advance!</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2014 07:53:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3688/video-full-screen-in-container/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,
