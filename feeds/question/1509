I presume it’s a tool which checks whether any updates are available via apt, so it’s distribution-specific, right?</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 11:02:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1509/what-is-a-good-update-notifier-for-i3/?comment=1511#comment-1511</guid></item><item><title>Answer by smiszym for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know a good update notifier for i3?

But if you installed i3 manually (for example by downloading sources and compiling them), you should do updates manually too.</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2013 14:52:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1509/what-is-a-good-update-notifier-for-i3/?answer=2122#post-id-2122</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;If you installed i3 via package manager such as apt or pacman, you should configure it to confirm new updates.

So, it is actually for other packages.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 22:13:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1509/what-is-a-good-update-notifier-for-i3/?comment=2129#comment-2129</guid></item><item><title>Answer by sycamorex for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know a good update notifier for i3?

"No updates available" or "Time to update" and display the contents of the file in i3status?</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 05:23:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1509/what-is-a-good-update-notifier-for-i3/?answer=2132#post-id-2132</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;Why don't you create a short script that would run apt-get in a crontab to be run regularly and save the results in a file (eg.

But, if there are no other options, then, I guess this is the way to go.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 06:12:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1509/what-is-a-good-update-notifier-for-i3/?comment=2133#comment-2133</guid></item></channel></rss>
