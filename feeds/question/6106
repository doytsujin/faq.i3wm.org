But the instance opened from command line shows unicode fine.

Similar problem: If I open the first gnome-instance using Alt-enter, it doesn't show unicode, but if the first instance is opened from another terminal, say urxvt, then it shows unicode fine. All further instances of gnome-terminal have the behavior as first instance of gnome-terminal.

It doesn't fix by rebooting.. I'm on i3 version 4.7.2 (2014-01-23, branch "tags/4.7.2") 

Similar problem here too: http://pdp.microjoe.org/forums/sujet/327/problemes-dunicode-avec-urxvt


EDIT: Fixed the problem- my global locale settings didn't handle UTF_8. Locally they did. Changed global settings and logged out and logged back in and everything is fine now. </description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:40:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6106/urxvt-not-handling-utf-8-when-started-from-i3-commands/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;When using urxvt inside i3, using Alt-enter creates a instance that doesn't show Unicode.
