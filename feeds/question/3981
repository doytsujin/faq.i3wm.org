</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3981/different-width-for-each-border/?comment=3982#comment-3982</link><description>I intended to try that setup because I don't see the purpose of the top and left borders (assuming you don't want the window titles). Perhaps it would make the border coloring more visible if it took all the space between windows instead of just half of it</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2014 17:43:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3981/different-width-for-each-border/?comment=3982#comment-3982</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to, for example, remove or change the width of the top and left borders of the windows while keeping the bottom and right?&lt;/p&gt;

Long answer: There's an option, "hide_edge_borders" (mentioned in the i3 User's Guide) that can hide window borders around the edges of the screen, but the width of the borders can't be controlled, and it only applies to borders, not titlebars.

I'll accept the answer and assume it's definitive. I'll change it if it turns out there's some way</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2014 19:07:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3981/different-width-for-each-border/?comment=3984#comment-3984</guid></item></channel></rss>
