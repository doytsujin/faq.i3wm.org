Please ask such questions on our IRC channel or the mailing list, the faq is not a good format for them. In principle, you can load a layout file as often as you want.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 08:42:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5659/how-to-reload-a-layout/?comment=5666#comment-5666</guid></item></channel></rss>
