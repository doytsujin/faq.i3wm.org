One possibility to achieve this would be to use a combination of IPC for setting the windows title and i3 configuration for the shortcuts.
But I can't find how to subscribe to window events and get something like 'new window' and 'closed window'.

As I'm starting to understand Michael philosophy I'm sure it is intended and there must be another 'more standard' way to do it.

Anyone could point me in the right direction ?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1345/is-it-possible-to-subscribe-to-window-event/?answer=1354#post-id-1354</link><description>I played a bit with it, the event on window works great for the property change = new.

In order to be able to prepend numbers to windows with IPC I need some other properties:

- window -&gt; change = title
- window -&gt; change = delete

I also need a new command for window like the rename workspace command.

Is there any thing like this implemented ?

If not I will try to hack something.

PS: I mark the question as answered since the subject was to subscribe to window event.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 06:02:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1345/is-it-possible-to-subscribe-to-window-event/?answer=1354#post-id-1354</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I played a bit with it, the event on window works great for the property change = new.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1345/is-it-possible-to-subscribe-to-window-event/?answer=1349#post-id-1349</link><description>There is a window event (in the git version):
http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_window_event

You won’t get the window event when closing a window, but patches for that will be accepted.

Please keep us updated about your script, I think it’s an interesting one.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 18:11:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1345/is-it-possible-to-subscribe-to-window-event/?answer=1349#post-id-1349</guid></item><item><title>Comment by syl20bnr for &lt;p&gt;There is a window event (in the git version):
