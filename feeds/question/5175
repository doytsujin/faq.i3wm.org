I compiled i3 a few weeks ago, and I'm now trying to patch it for xmb support: so I need to uninstall previous version to be clean.
So I went in the sources folder and tried "make uninstall"... But there is no target!

How can I properly remove this?</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5175/uninstall-from-sources/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

There is no support at all for installing i3 from source, and the lack of an uninstall target is part of that :).</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 19:28:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5175/uninstall-from-sources/?answer=5192#post-id-5192</guid></item></channel></rss>
