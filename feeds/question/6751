Now, using only the window focus changing keys, I can move from “A” to “B”, but not back. For that, I have to use desktop switching keys.

Is there a way how to easily change the focus between floating and nonfloating windows on two displays?</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 06:40:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6751/leave-a-floating-only-desktop/</guid></item></channel></rss>
