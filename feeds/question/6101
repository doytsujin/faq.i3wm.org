When using i3, the laptop wakes up from suspend but the screen is garbled, and I need to reboot, not even a lightdm restart helps.

I am using unity-settings-daemon, should I start another process that fixes this and is already running in unity?

This is actually a cross post from [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/634544/screen-garbled-after-suspend-when-not-using-unity) I am posting it also here because it might be a i3wm specific issue?
