on a related note, I'd also really like to see a configuration option to disable wrapping.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 10:16:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1083/focus-follows-screen-layout/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I like to work with four identical terminals. sometimes they result from horizontal, then vertical splitting, sometimes the other way around. this leads to (for me) unintuitive behaviour when moving focus around. for example, 'focus up' sometimes goes the up+left, or 'focus left' actually goes down+left.

Apart from that, there is no i3 built-in to achieve what you want.

Also, I am not very keen to add more options with regards to wrapping behavior.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 10:59:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1083/focus-follows-screen-layout/?answer=1084#post-id-1084</guid></item></channel></rss>
