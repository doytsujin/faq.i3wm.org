I'm new to i3wm. I was using gnome-shell 3.14 till now. My problem now is applications like google-chrome etc fonts and toolbars are really big. But applications like urxvt are fine. I've tried all solutions given here. https://faq.i3wm.org/question/115/how-to-configure-gtk-theme-support/

Can you please suggest how to fix this. I'm asking again since the answers in the above mentioned thread are atleast a year old.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6218/application-texts-and-toolbars-are-big/?answer=6220#post-id-6220</link><description>Lxappearance works very well to set gtk-theming and fonts and it has no dependencies which is really cool I think.
The described way to simply edit .gtkrc-2.0 works too and if you don't change your theming all the time, it's a simple and clean solution.
gnome-settings-daemon will pull in a lot of gnome-dependencies. So if you're not actually using gnome shell anymore I would not recommend that.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2015 13:51:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6218/application-texts-and-toolbars-are-big/?answer=6220#post-id-6220</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adarsh for &lt;p&gt;Lxappearance works very well to set gtk-theming and fonts and it has no dependencies which is really cool I think.

Its no more lxde or lxqt than any other app, its just the name you don't like obviously ;) Native i3 would be to edit .gtkrc-2.0 manually or write a little script with some of your preferred settings t! :)</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 08:21:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6218/application-texts-and-toolbars-are-big/?comment=6225#comment-6225</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adarsh for &lt;p&gt;Lxappearance works very well to set gtk-theming and fonts and it has no dependencies which is really cool I think.
