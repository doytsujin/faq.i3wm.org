When I do this the scratchpad is shown but when releasing the key, the scratchpad is not hidden.

    bindsym Super_L+Alt_L scratchpad show
    bindsym --release $mod+Alt_L scratchpad

To try something simpler I also tried to just use Super_L as the key but this didn't work. Do you have any ideas?

-edit
I found that when I tap Alt_L, the scratchpad is shown/hidden, this is actually nice and I think I will use this. But please let me know if you have any answer for this anyway.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 22:08:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3891/show-window-in-scratchpad-only-when-key-is-pressed/</guid></item></channel></rss>
