 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/118/mouse-cursor-remains-waiting-after-closing-last-tile/?answer=120#post-id-120</link><description>This is due to startup notifications which are still running for some application. After 1 minute, the startup notification will time out.

To avoid this, use applications which support startup-notification (basically everything which is GTK/Qt, but also urxvt, …). If your application does not support it, start it using exec --no-startup-id, for example:

    bindsym $mod+x exec --no-startup-id xterm

Note that this is not the default because you lose some functionality without startup notifications:

1. Your cursor will no longer indicate that an application is starting.
2. i3 will not be able to place the corresponding window on the same workspace on which the application was started.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2012 10:44:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/118/mouse-cursor-remains-waiting-after-closing-last-tile/?answer=120#post-id-120</guid></item><item><title>Comment by srepmub for &lt;p&gt;This is due to startup notifications which are still running for some application.
