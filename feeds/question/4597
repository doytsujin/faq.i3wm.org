Is it possible to launch certain applications in full screen?

A bit more precisely:  I use gitg to commit to git repos and the repeated steps I do are:

 1. type `gitg` in the root of the project I'm working on
 2. push Windows-F to put it in full screen, because it starts in tiling mode
 3. i have to adjust the border between the staging area and the commit message, because it gets shrinked while it was in tiling mode
 4. do the commit and exit

I would love to just type `gitg` and do the git commit, sparing the switchin to full screen and the border adjustment.  All I need is to somehow tell i3 that gitg is an exception and it should be always launched in full screen mode.

Is this possible?

(Creating a key binding for gitg is not a solution here, because I have to launch it in the projects root directory.  Once launching gitg and putting it to the scratchpad is also a nice thing, but not applicable here.)

`gitg` windows for example have the *WM_CLASS* "Gitg". So if you add this to your `~/.i3/config`:

    for_window [class="^Gitg$"] fullscreen

any `gitg` window will be made fullscreen immediatelly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 12:25:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4597/full-screen/?answer=4598#post-id-4598</guid></item></channel></rss>
