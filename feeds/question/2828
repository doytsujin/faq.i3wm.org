 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2828/open-application-and-fix-workspace/?answer=2830#post-id-2830</link><description>This already works, if you use

    i3-msg exec application

to start your application it will appear on the workspace on which you called it. [See here](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#exec)


----------
For example, if you are using dmenu_run to start your application you can use this instead:

    #!/bin/sh
    exe=`dmenu_path | dmenu ${1+"$@"}` &amp;&amp; i3-msg "exec $exe"

Is there a variable which contains the current worksp. so i can set it explict? </description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 14:07:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2828/open-application-and-fix-workspace/?comment=2835#comment-2835</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;This already works, if you use&lt;/p&gt;

You can retrieve the current workspace with `i3-msg -t get_workspaces`. This returns a list of all workspaces in JSON format. The current one has its "focused" flag set to true.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 21:06:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2828/open-application-and-fix-workspace/?comment=2836#comment-2836</guid></item><item><title>Answer by benkaiser for &lt;p&gt;If i launch an application lets say on workspace1 and switch to another workspace before

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2828/open-application-and-fix-workspace/?answer=3379#post-id-3379</link><description>I wrote a python script to implement this. So here is my config:

    bindsym $mod+d exec /path/to/script.py

And my script contains the following, apologies for the verbosity:

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    import subprocess
    import json
    from os.path import expanduser
    
    def get_workspace():
      test = subprocess.Popen(["i3-msg","-t","get_workspaces"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
      output = test.communicate()[0]
      data = json.loads(output.decode())
      data = sorted(data, key=lambda k: k['name']) 
      for i in data:
        if(i['focused']):
          return i['name']

    home = expanduser("~")
    applications = open(home+"/.cache/dmenu_run")
    dmenu_run = subprocess.Popen(["dmenu","-b"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=applications)
    output = (dmenu_run.communicate()[0]).decode().strip()
    subprocess.Popen(["i3-msg","workspace "+get_workspace()+"; exec " + output], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    
The script simply:

 1. Pipes the current dmenu_run cache (located at ~/.cache/dmenu_run) of applications to dmenu
 2. Gets the result from dmenu and calls `i3msg 'workspace &lt;current&gt;; exec &lt;dmenu_result&gt;'` where `current` is the current workspace and `dmenu_result` is what you enter into the dmenu prompt

But there are some exception as the document says. chromium won't work with cgroups but might be fixable with startup-notification awareness. urxvt could be solved with either.
