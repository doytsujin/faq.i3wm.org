Is any of you using Eclipse? I haven't found this issue mentioned anywhere: since I switched to i3 I can't rearrange the tabs in Eclipse to create columns or rows, so I'm stuck to one editor in a big monitor.

While I drag the tab, the whole screen flickers full of glitches (like video memory being sampled from random locations). When I release the mouse the tab normally jumps back to where it was, sometimes it just floats as a new window, but it never splits the screen. With Unity it works fine.

I'm very much into glitch art, but not when dragging tabs around :) Any tips?

Update: With version 4.8, there is improvement, but it still does not behave normal.

* It's now possible to place tabs side by side or on top of each other, but it can't be properly controlled. It only works if I drag the tab 10 pixels down, and I drop it on top of the first line of code. Then, if Eclipse is on my horizontal monitor, the editor window jumps to the right of the existing editor. If Eclipse is on my vertical monitor, it seems to jump below the other editor.
* The glitch is now "only" white flickering (no random video data in it). One flash for every pixel I move the mouse. The flickering does not happen on the top area (where dropping works), but it happens inside the overlaid rectangles displayed by Eclipse to help you place your tab. If I try to drop the tab where it should work, it jumps back to where it was. The overlaid rectangles are not shown where they should be, but offset down and right.

I wonder if it's my 4 year old video card. I will have a new laptop this week, maybe that solves the problem.</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2014 16:34:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5060/eclipse-glitchy-flickering-when-dragging-a-tab/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;Hi, &lt;/p&gt;

Mouse is still required to resize, and to drop editors next to the desired tab. Then you press a key to do a H or V split. Not perfect, but usable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2014 15:11:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5060/eclipse-glitchy-flickering-when-dragging-a-tab/?comment=5089#comment-5089</guid></item><item><title>Comment by qrunchis for &lt;p&gt;Hi, &lt;/p&gt;
