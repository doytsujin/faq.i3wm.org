That setting only gives me what I want when having only one container/window open: no borders.

If I have say two stacked terminals open, this setting will only show a border inbetween those terminals. Using pixel 1 for a border, still makes it hard to distinguish which of both windows is the active one.

AFAICS, only some IPC script would solve this case. If anyone has some pointer on how to start looking at the problem... </description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 22:11:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3107/disable-border-if-only-one-window-is-opened-on-a-workspace/?answer=6168#post-id-6168</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I'm looking for a way to automatically disable borders if a window is alone on a workspace.

I totally missed this, probably thought it's just another option to set normal border size. 
Thanks for answering, by the way.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3107/disable-border-if-only-one-window-is-opened-on-a-workspace/?comment=3126#comment-3126</guid></item></channel></rss>
