now i would really do the same with i3,
i tryed with env var of kde, or from the GUI =&gt;  default windows manager , even editing ~/.xinitrc and trying to execute i3 from there
but nothing worked,

i can run i3 or KDE (with kwin) alone but not KDE with i3

i really love i3 but kde bar , program links, and automations still being usefull to help me during transition

p.s.:
i'm currently running kde 4.11.3 and i3 version  4.6

   [https://github.com/pablospe/i3wm](https://github.com/pablospe/i3wm)

I've followed his instructions (with the previous code), and works pretty well with kde:

After a short bit you'll be fine enough. 

Just make sure you know how to start and stop applications ([this Q may help](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/25/how-to-launch-applications-in-i3/)). For finding where windows are buried, [have a look](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/228/how-do-i-find-an-app-buried-in-some-workspace-by-its-title/) here. 

I am not familiar with desktop environments, but gnome appears to use `gnome-settings-daemon` which makes all kinds of stuff happen automatically (mount drives, key ring authentication, etc). It might be that your life will be easier if you can enable the hidden KDE magic. 

Good luck :) </description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2013 18:37:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2939/i3wm-and-kde-together/?answer=2940#post-id-2940</guid></item><item><title>Comment by DavidGamba for &lt;p&gt;I would say: If you want to try the transition: Bite the bullet, and forget about the buttons and other visual hints desktop environments are offering.

At the end of the day linux is about choice and finding workflows that work for the individual. I like the speed of movement that tiling gives me but I am not 100% interested in the minimalistic environment.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 18:48:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2939/i3wm-and-kde-together/?comment=3767#comment-3767</guid></item><item><title>Comment by etaca3 for &lt;p&gt;I would say: If you want to try the transition: Bite the bullet, and forget about the buttons and other visual hints desktop environments are offering.

i made it :) 

there was this awesome tutorial for awesome wm :) 
http :// awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/KDE_and_awesome 

which wasn't working for i3wm, but changing the Type from "Xsession" to "Application" it worked:
so : 
to have i3wm working with kde4
you should already have this folder in your system : 
/usr/share/kde4/apps/ksmserver/windowmanagers/
(if not maybe this solution doesn't work for you ) 
create a file named 
/usr/share/kde4/apps/ksmserver/windowmanagers/i3.desktop

with content :

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8 
Name=i3
Comment=Highly configurable framework window manager 
Type=Application
Exec=i3
TryExec=i3

and :
Now, you should be able to choose "i3" as window manager in System Settings-Default Applications-&gt;Window Manager
&lt;/pre&gt;
