I would like to act upon any window that is set as floating so I can be able to set border as normal when in floating mode and 1pixel when in tabbed mode.

As for now I am able to do this but only for selected applications via `for_window [...]`, however I would like to extend this behaviour for any and all applications.

Regards.

    #!/bin/bash
    i=0
    i3subscribe window dump | grep --line-buffered -e "^window:floating" -e "floating' =&gt; 'user_" | sed -u 's/^\s*//' | \
    while read -r line; do
    	[ "$line" == "window:floating" ] &amp;&amp; i=1 &amp;&amp; continue
    	[ "$i" == 1 -a "$line" == "'floating' =&gt; 'user_on'," ] &amp;&amp; i3-msg border normal
    	[ "$i" == 1 -a "$line" == "'floating' =&gt; 'user_off'," ] &amp;&amp; i3-msg border 1pixel
    	i=0
    done</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 19:36:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6020/how-to-detect-when-a-container-is-set-to-float/?answer=6022#post-id-6022</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
