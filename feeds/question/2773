That aside, as far as I can tell, '|' is on the '\'-key just right of Left-Shift on UK-QWERTY. So you actually type &lt;Shift&gt;+\ to get a '|'. Therefore

    bindsym $mod+Shift+backslash split h

should work in the expected way. (For me either - 'bar' or 'backslash' - works exactly the same way)

This works for me, too:

    bindsym $mod+bar split h

So the 'Shift' seems to be redundant.</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 12:13:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2773/unable-to-bind-anything-to-pipe-symbol-using-keyname/?answer=2775#post-id-2775</guid></item></channel></rss>
