Hello,

I'm pretty new to i3 and I ran into a serious problem with workspace switching. Since i am from Germany, my laptop keyboard has german layout. However, at work I use an external keyboard with us layout since for programming I like that layout better. I have thus written a small script that allows me to switch between german and us layout and I have successfully bound it to my F11 key. The command within the script are

'setxkbmap -layout de' and 'setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl'

So much for the setting, because I don't know if the problem is related to that. My problem is as follows: Having us layout enabled, whenever I press $mod+Shift+num, this does work only for a few numbers, namely 1,4,5,7,9,0 (strangely, the last three key combinations actually move the window to workspace 6,8,9 instead of 7,9,10). For the other numbers, doing it on a terminal gives @,#,^,* (which is Shift+num without the mod key). I have tries this with both mod4 and mod1 as mod key with the result being the same. However, with the german layout everything works well.

So do I have to change the keymap in a different fashion? Switching to us layout WITHOUT specifying -variant intl didn't change anything. I would be very glad for suggestions!

Best,
Michael</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 14:57:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1312/problem-with-moving-windows-between-workspaces-on-us-keyboard-layout/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: As the comment of njsg states, the obvious solution are keycodes instead of keysyms.

However, at work I use an external keyboard with us layout since for programming I like that layout better. I have thus written a small script that allows me to switch between german and us layout and I have successfully bound it to my F11 key. The command within the script are&lt;/p&gt;

My problem is as follows: Having us layout enabled, whenever I press $mod+Shift+num, this does work only for a few numbers, namely 1,4,5,7,9,0 (strangely, the last three key combinations actually move the window to workspace 6,8,9 instead of 7,9,10).
