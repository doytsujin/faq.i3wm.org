For console, I consider Midnight Commander superior, but it's always good to learn about alternatives.

EDIT:
Certainly, console itself is a very capable file manager what has been pointed in answers below. I should have clarified the question is about dedicated file management applications.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2012 00:52:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/92/what-is-recommended-file-manager-for-i3wm/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by matma6 for &lt;p&gt;I'm looking for suggestions of i3-friendly file manager which&lt;/p&gt;

Nautilus is fully-featured, but it is not even close to what I consider as file management ergonomy. Ideal combination of GUI with keyboard and features is Total Commander, but it's Windows-only.
