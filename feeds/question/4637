My problem is the key binding - I need the kiosk to be foolproof. In previous wm (matchbox) xmodmap was great, but with i3 it seems it is completely ignored (for example disabling F11 in xmodmap was unachievable - loaded from .xinitrc). But disabling with bindcode and bindsym could work.

Can I use exhausting bindcode/bindsym configuration where I effectively disable all i3 stuff? Is there a list or command to list all active keybindings? Can I just do something like:
`bindsym $mod exec /bin/true`

or something similar and be done with it?

I need to make F1-12 keys and their combinations to do nothing and also some other shortcuts (ctrl+n, and combination with mod key). Plus I want to eliminate all i3 special keybinding. With another wm (matchbox) I used xmodmap to render F11 useless (toggle fullscreen) and other F-keys too.

EDIT:

So, xmodmap I didn't make to work with i3, so at least I understood a little bit how i3 config file works (I think), but one last problem remains. I need to disable WinKey+F1-12 and when I try `bindsym Mod4+F1 exec --no-startup-id /bin/true` it does not work, for disabling F11 key this does work `bindsym F11 exec --no-startup-id /bin/true` so I guess syntax is ok.

EDIT 2:

After a while I returned to this Kiosk problem and finally solved it!

I managed to disable all F-keys, combinations with Win-key (Super_L) and also succeed in disabling Menu key and Right-Click button!

I cannot post files so just snippets - I needed to have this in my i3 config:
`bindcode 67 --no-startup-id /bin/true`
.
.
.

but it didn't work alone (and not without it also...), but I added this MAGIC:
`exec_always --no-startup-id /usr/bin/xmodmap /home/live/.Xmodmap`
and in .Xmodmap is:
`keycode 67 = NoSymbol`
.
.
.
`keycode 133= NoSymbol` &lt;&lt;&lt; THIS IS WIN-KEY
and added also this for menu key and right-click:
`keycode 135= NoSymbol` &lt;&lt;&lt; I have czech layout (xev is your friend)

&lt;p&gt;So, xmodmap I didn't make to work with i3, so at least I understood a little bit how i3 config file works (I think), but one last problem remains. I need to disable WinKey+F1-12 and when I try &lt;code&gt;bindsym Mod4+F1 exec --no-startup-id /bin/true&lt;/code&gt; it does not work, for disabling F11 key this does work &lt;code&gt;bindsym F11 exec --no-startup-id /bin/true&lt;/code&gt; so I guess syntax is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while I returned to this Kiosk problem and finally solved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to disable all F-keys, combinations with Win-key (Super_L) and also succeed in disabling Menu key and Right-Click button!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot post files so just snippets - I needed to have this in my i3 config:
&lt;code&gt;bindcode 67 --no-startup-id /bin/true&lt;/code&gt;
.
.
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but it didn't work alone (and not without it also...), but I added this MAGIC:
&lt;code&gt;exec_always --no-startup-id /usr/bin/xmodmap /home/live/.Xmodmap&lt;/code&gt;
and in .Xmodmap is:
&lt;code&gt;keycode 67 = NoSymbol&lt;/code&gt;
.
.
.
&lt;code&gt;keycode 133= NoSymbol&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; THIS IS WIN-KEY
and added also this for menu key and right-click:
&lt;code&gt;keycode 135= NoSymbol&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; I have czech layout (xev is your friend)
&lt;code&gt;pointer = 1 2 32 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 3&lt;/code&gt;

I hadn't published it before because I think kiosks cover a much wider range of use cases than I am picturing.

&lt;p&gt;My problem is the key binding - I need the kiosk to be foolproof. In previous wm (matchbox) xmodmap was great, but with i3 it seems it is completely ignored (for example disabling F11 in xmodmap was unachievable - loaded from .xinitrc). But disabling with bindcode and bindsym could work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I use exhausting bindcode/bindsym configuration where I effectively disable all i3 stuff? Is there a list or command to list all active keybindings? Can I just do something like:
&lt;code&gt;bindsym $mod exec /bin/true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or something similar and be done with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to make F1-12 keys and their combinations to do nothing and also some other shortcuts (ctrl+n, and combination with mod key). Plus I want to eliminate all i3 special keybinding. With another wm (matchbox) I used xmodmap to render F11 useless (toggle fullscreen) and other F-keys too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, xmodmap I didn't make to work with i3, so at least I understood a little bit how i3 config file works (I think), but one last problem remains.
