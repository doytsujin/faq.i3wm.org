I can't find a way to increase the font size of the application launcher menu (dmenu / j4-dmenu).

Is there way to do that?

&lt;code&gt;dmenu_run -fn '-*-fixed-bold-r-normal-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1'&lt;/code&gt;

As stated above I added this to the dmenu call in the Main.hh of j4-dmenu-desktop and it works fine after recompiling.

You simply need to edit the part of **i3-dmenu-desktop/j4-dmenu** that calls dmenu and add the '-fn' flag to your taste. Personally, I've just tied **dmenu_run** to a keybinding in my config:

    bindsym $mod+space exec dmenu_run -i -b -p 'Arch Linux' -fn 'Ubuntu Mono:bold:pixelsize=15' -nb '#fdf6e3' -nf '#586c75' -sf '#fdf6e3' -sb '#b58900'

The dmenu man page has all the information on what those flags do. I'd rather have complete control over how dmenu looks and behaves than a pre-made script that tells me what I want. I'll tell *you* what I want, dmenu, thank you very much. ;)

Also, note that you'd need to build dmenu yourself with the [Xft](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xft) patch to use TTF fonts; otherwise you'd need to use xfont-style notation to declare the font.</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 14:40:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4219/increase-font-size-of-dmenu-j4-dmenu/?answer=4221#post-id-4221</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with j4-dmenu, but the font size of dmenu itself is dictated by the '-fn' flag used when it's launched. &lt;strong&gt;i3-dmenu-desktop&lt;/strong&gt; is a nice convenience, but that's really all it is---the only thing that makes it different from plain old dmenu is that it specifically searches for *.desktop files rather than all executable files in $PATH.

Changing j4-dmenu-desktop's call to dmenu did the trick. I've edited the Main.hh to include the font specification when calling dmenu and it works flawlessly now. </description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 08:57:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4219/increase-font-size-of-dmenu-j4-dmenu/?comment=4230#comment-4230</guid></item></channel></rss>
