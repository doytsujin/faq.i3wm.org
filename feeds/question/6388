    set $mod Mod1
    set $sup Mod4

I quickly realised afterwards that it ruined my emacs keybindings so now I want to change it back.  However nothing works, I've swapped the two commands around above, but still meta is the modifier key.  Clearly I am missing something!

PS I used xev and can confirm that windows key is returning `Super_L,` and the alt key is returning `Alt_L`.  Anyone help me with this one please?</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 23:34:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6388/unable-to-change-modifier-key-from-meta-to-super/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hello, when I first started out I used super as the modifier key, I chose this at the start up wizard, then I decided to change the mod key to meta/alt (whatever it's called) using this in the ~/.i3/config  :&lt;/p&gt;

Do your `bindsym`/`bindcode` command actually utilize `$mod` or `$sup` (e.g. `bindsym $mod+Shift+x exec xclock`)?</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 12:43:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6388/unable-to-change-modifier-key-from-meta-to-super/?comment=6391#comment-6391</guid></item></channel></rss>
