When I close Chrome using $mod+Shift+q, the app remains at the screen but it doesn't disappear until I move to another desktop. 
Is that a normal behaviour?

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?comment=5881#comment-5881</link><description>It happens with all the applications too.
And I haven't change the background color or image, is the behaviour I encountered when i3 was installed, without tweaking it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 10:19:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?comment=5881#comment-5881</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mickkelo for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?comment=5876#comment-5876</link><description>It sounds as if the root window ("background") is not redrawn. Do you set a background color or image? And does the problem persist if you run `xsetroot -gray`?</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 06:31:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?comment=5876#comment-5876</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?answer=5886#post-id-5886</link><description>ok, seems adding:

&gt; xsetroot -gray

to my .profile solves the problem.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 15:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?answer=5886#post-id-5886</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?answer=5889#post-id-5889</link><description>As setting a background seems to solve the problem, you can just put 

    exec --no-startup-id xsetroot -gray

into your `~/.i3/config` and it will be run when *i3* starts up.

Of course you can use any other command that sets a background color, pattern or image instead of `xsetroot -gray`.

----

The issue here was, that there was no content set for the root window (what is sometimes called desktop). Therefore when the last window on a workspace gets closed, *i3* has nothing to draw for the root window (which then becomes visible) and an image of the last window remains. And it is just an image, the application itself terminated successfully and the actual window was closed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 05:58:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5874/window-does-not-disappear-when-closing-app/?answer=5889#post-id-5889</guid></item></channel></rss>
