I installed i3 on Ubuntu 15.04 via the repo. When an app crashes (e.g. VLC or Mendeley), I get no error message, alert popup, or ubuntu's "send report to developers" dialog. It just looks like the app decided to cleanly close the window (which is not what happens, due to Mendeley warning me of a crash/recovery the next time I start it). How can I get big loud error messages after a window crashes in i3?

What I primarily want to know is if and why the app crashed.

Thanks!</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 15:04:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6774/how-to-get-alert-messages-on-application-crash-in-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know if there are independent tools doing this though.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 15:06:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6774/how-to-get-alert-messages-on-application-crash-in-i3/?comment=6776#comment-6776</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
