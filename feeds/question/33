If we were to implement all these little things, i3lock would explode with complexity. It is far easier (in the big picture) to use GIMP or any other image manipulation tool to create an image which suits your screen resolution and just use that.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2012 06:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/33/how-can-i-specify-the-image-position-in-i3lock/?answer=34#post-id-34</guid></item><item><title>Comment by oberon for &lt;p&gt;You can’t.

At least the ability to center an image would be extremely helpful here.</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2015 21:02:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/33/how-can-i-specify-the-image-position-in-i3lock/?comment=6702#comment-6702</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ab5tract for &lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if there is a way to specify the position (or center) the image given by -i.&lt;/p&gt;
