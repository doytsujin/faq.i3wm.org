I am using i3 gaps by airblader, but i recall having the same issue with vanilla i3.

Here is an image of the off center text i am describing:
[default height](http://i.imgur.com/nxmYAzb.png)

That is with the default height. The effect is more pronounced if i use a larger height.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5930/off-center-text-in-status-bar/?answer=5937#post-id-5937</link><description>The issue seems to be with the font i was using, font awesome. The only reason i was using font awesome was for their icons. You can set up your fonts so that there is a fallback font if the symbols aren't in the first font. So setting font awesome as a fall back font allows you to have an arbitrary font for text and font awesome for icons only.

The following config lines have solved my problem.

     bar {
          font pango: Inconsolata, FontAwesome 10
    }

This will both center the text and display the icons you want.
