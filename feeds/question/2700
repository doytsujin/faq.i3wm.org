First I want to say thanks to you i3 wizards; this wm rocks!

i3 allows the user to left-click or scroll with the mouse wheel to select a tabbed window.

i3 also allows the user to switch workspaces by left-clicking on the workspace graphic or scrolling the mouse on the status bar. 

I accidentally use these features when I don't want to, so I'd like to disable both of these features.

The only mouse feature want to use in the i3 interface is sizing split windows. For everything else the keyboard works perfectly well for me.

If anyone knows how to disable these settings I'd love to hear how!</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:46:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2700/disable-mouse-on-interface/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by SexyBachelor for &lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;

You should ask for a feature request if you really want it. This question was answer already here:

I only searched the faq for clicking which is why I didn't find that other question. I'll definitely post up a feature request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2013 15:22:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2700/disable-mouse-on-interface/?comment=2705#comment-2705</guid></item></channel></rss>
