I recently installed i3wm on my Ubuntu laptop. While I do love it I also miss some of the applets available in the status bar of ubuntu-desktop. Most of all, I miss the calendar applet. I liked being able to click it and have it show me the calendar for the month in a small menu-like pop-up without having to open a separate window, and then being able to close it with only one click. 

I've been trying to look for something similar to install in the i3wm status bar but no amounts of googling have been enough. I've found different calendar software, that are very fancy and well but they open a new window which is really annoying in i3. I would like something similar to whenever I click the nm-applet and it displays a menu without having to open a window. So by clicking the calendar button it will display a small calendar at the bottom without opening a window.

I have for the most part been able to google my way through most the things I've wanted to configure but I have not been able to find a proper answer to this. Do you guys know if there is any calendar applet that I can install that lets me do what I want?</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 07:50:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4607/simple-calendar-applet/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunatelly the *i3bar* does not (yet) handle mouse clicks, but for now you could just create a key binding

    bindsym $mod+c exec zenity --calendar

This will call up a small dialog window with a calendar. Pressing *Escape*, *Enter* or *Space* will close the window again.

Also, there is the program `cal` (in package *bsdmainutils*) for the command line.

It also opens a floating window, which can be configured
to close when you click outside it
(`echo 'close_on_unfocus = 1' &gt;&gt; ~/.config/gsimplecal/config`).</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 21:21:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4607/simple-calendar-applet/?answer=4619#post-id-4619</guid></item><item><title>Comment by AndresMe for &lt;p&gt;Not exactly what you're looking for, but I can recommend &lt;code&gt;gsimplecal&lt;/code&gt;.
