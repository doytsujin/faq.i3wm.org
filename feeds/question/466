1) Say I have a *xterm* in the scratchpad and it remains open in say *workspace 1*. When I want to access it from *workspace 2*, currently I am moving to the previous workspace, toggling the *xterm* back to scratchpad and opening it again in *workspace 2*. Is there a way for the *scratchpad xterm* to move back to scratchpad if open else where and reappear in the current workspace?

2) How do you mark a browser using *con_mark*?

3) How do you find out the workspace of a marked window? Or for that matter the workspace of any window that matches a criteria?

I would like to apologize if the **documentation** or the **FAQ** already covers this, but I could not locate it.

Thanks for any help.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 08:32:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/466/regarding-workspace-info-con_mark-and-scratchpad/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I have a few questions -&lt;/p&gt;

This is an explicit example over there (albeit with a mark of 1 character long). Bind it to a key to have it work on the currently focused window. 

Questions 1 and 3 seem a bit too complicated for i3-input, as there are no possibilities for if-statements, and for advanced input, like a dynamically generated list of workspaces. You can use the IPC interface and the existing libraries to do this. 

You might want to have a look at the winmenu example of [i3-py](https://github.com/ziberna/i3-py) It uses dmenu to have you 'jump' to a window. [This version](https://github.com/joepvd/i3-py/blob/master/examples/winmenu.py) has support for marks, as in it will display them. If you type something that cannot be matched to a window, it will mark the currently focused window with what you just typed. </description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 08:53:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/466/regarding-workspace-info-con_mark-and-scratchpad/?answer=467#post-id-467</guid></item><item><title>Comment by spordha for &lt;p&gt;As for question 2: Have a look at the man-page for i3-input.

I just created a keybinding with the i3-input command.

When I type the command in a terminal it seems to mark that terminal. But for a non-terminal window, I am not sure what to do.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 09:14:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/466/regarding-workspace-info-con_mark-and-scratchpad/?comment=468#comment-468</guid></item></channel></rss>
