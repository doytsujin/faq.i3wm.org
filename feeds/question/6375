I cannot figure out why i3bar is not accepting the settings I am entering for the colors.
My bar section in ~/.i3/config reads (I was using red for testing):

    bar {
        output            default
        status_command    i3status
        workspace_buttons yes
        tray_output       none
        
        colors {
            background #ff0000
            statusline #ffffff
    
        }
    }


But the i3 bar background is black. When I enter green (#00FF00) for the background color, the i3bar background is yellow. In general, any i3bar color I specify (except black and white) are not showing up as expected and I don't know why. Colors for my terminal application (urxvt) are displaying fine and as expected (as read from ~/.Xresources).
