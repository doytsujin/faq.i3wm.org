are there any future plans for i3 to support high resolution displays using some kind of upscaling? 
I just bought an fullhd 15,6 inch notebook, and realized that the resolution is pretty damn small but I also really would like to work with i3.
I know its possible to change fontsize etc. but this makes some problems i.e. when using multiple monitors (like in my case) and only one is highres.

There are some Solutions in Development for Gnome 3.12 / Unity etc. which made quite some progress. So it would be interesting to know if there are any plans ?
I think since display resolution will increase even further  this issues should be concerned somewhere in the future.

Note that the applications you use with i3 are entirely separate and you need to make sure those support HiDPI — that’s outside i3’s control.</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2014 13:22:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3623/hi-dpi-support/?answer=3624#post-id-3624</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;i3 already supports HiDPI since version 4.7.

This is a long-standing design problem with X11.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:36:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3623/hi-dpi-support/?comment=3666#comment-3666</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jr for &lt;p&gt;i3 already supports HiDPI since version 4.7.
