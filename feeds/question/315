I've disabled xinerama and am not using the force_xinerama configuration directive, because that turns the first two screens into 1 large workspace, which isn't ideal.

Here's my xrandr output:

$ xrandr --screen 0
[...]
VGA-0 connected 1080x1920+1080+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm 
DVI-I-1 connected 1080x1920+0+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm x 

$ xrandr --screen 1
[...]
DVI-I-1 connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm

When I startx, i3 creates two workspace - one on each of the first two monitors, but nothing shows up on the 3rd monitor except for the background image. I can mouse around the 3rd monitor, but it does not have an active workspace (I cannot run applications in it).

This works with other WMs, though, where the 3rd monitor gets its own separate Xsession (at least, I think that's what's happening). For instance, with XFCE4 the 3rd monitor has its own panel and although I cannot move windows between the 3rd and either of the first two monitors, it is still a fairly nice and useable setup.

It'd be great if this would work with i3 - multiple-monitors on multiple-graphics cards is too nice a feature to give up.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2012 21:55:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/315/how-can-i-use-i3-with-multiple-graphic-cards/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by c1b3rh4ck for &lt;p&gt;I have a triple monitor setup, with 2 monitors connected to 1 graphic card, and the 3rd monitor connected to a second graphic card (both nvidia, using the 302.17 binary driver).&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/315/how-can-i-use-i3-with-multiple-graphic-cards/?answer=358#post-id-358</link><description>As you mentioned, you need to start multiple instances of i3 in your `~/.xsession`, such as:

    DISPLAY=:1 i3 &amp;
    exec i3

(untested, but you should get the idea)

Also, using force_xinerama does not turn multiple screens into one big workspace — only if you have not setup the nvidia driver correctly.

You could also try upgrading the nvidia driver. Starting from version 302.17 it supports XRandR.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 13:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/315/how-can-i-use-i3-with-multiple-graphic-cards/?answer=358#post-id-358</guid></item><item><title>Comment by c1b3rh4ck for &lt;p&gt;As you mentioned, you need to start multiple instances of i3 in your &lt;code&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/code&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
