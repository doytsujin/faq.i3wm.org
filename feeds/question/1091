2 % battery. Somehow in the last minute I saw the battery statistics.

The thing I don't get is is there a way to make the battery and CPU temperature use good, bad, degrade colours. It would be nice if I could adjust the values of those states for each module. It would also be nice if there was some flash coloe for which the i3bar would make that particular text flash. Or perhaps the nag-bar could be called.. </description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 18:56:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1091/i3bar-flashing-text-aka-the-color_very_bad/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;So the thing is that I just managed to save my session by going to sleep with

The battery text is automatically colored according to the threshold you configured. You might need to upgrade i3status in order to get this feature.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 19:07:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1091/i3bar-flashing-text-aka-the-color_very_bad/?answer=1092#post-id-1092</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;blockquote&gt;
