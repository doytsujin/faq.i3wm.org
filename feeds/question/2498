    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS

following script does it when started i.e. with gdm:
 

    /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/30-dbus     
     #!/bin/bash
     # launches a session dbus instance
     if [ -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ] &amp;&amp; type dbus-launch &gt;/dev/null; then
       eval $(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session)
     fi


to use it as an ssh-agent in X11:

    /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/50-gnome-keyring-daemon 
    if [ "$DESKTOP_SESSION" = "i3" ]; then
    	export $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets,ssh)
    fi

then if you wanna use it with chromium and the above conditions are met just launch `chromium --password-store=gnome`
libgnome-keyring does only initialize correctly when DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set and dbus is running.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2498/ssh-sessions-in-i3/?answer=4876#post-id-4876</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Hibou57 for &lt;p&gt;hello all, &lt;/p&gt;

From my understanding this executable replaces the old gnome-settings-daemon and takes care, like its old relative, to setup the agent and all the rest.

Launch i3 this way on ~/.xsession or through your favorite login manager:

&lt;p&gt;I've been using in i3 for a while, and loved it so much. The only thing I'm missing is, when I was using gnome DE, it was automatically remember my passphrase after login in one time. It was asking my pwd in a pop-up, i3 asks it on the command line itself;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter passphrase for key '/home/jeffisabelle/.ssh/id_rsa':&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the bad thing is, it asks every time I connect some server or use SCP to transfer files. Is there any way to use gnome's relevant utility for ssh connections? and if there is, how can I achieve this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not pretty sure how gnome handles those keys, but I found there is a utility called &lt;em&gt;gnome-keyring&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gnome-keyring-daemon&lt;/em&gt; but I couldn't get them working on i3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

	if [ "$0" = "/etc/gdm/Xsession" -a "$DESKTOP_SESSION" = "i3" ]; then
		export $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start)
		# SSH_AGENT_PID required to stop xinitrc-common from starting ssh-agent
		export SSH_AGENT_PID=${GNOME_KEYRING_PID:-gnome}
	fi

That should work with any window manager and avoids the need to override `~/.xsession` or `~/.xinitrc`, duplicating some system setup.

It's important to set `SSH_AGENT_PID` so that the system script doesn't start `ssh-agent`.
