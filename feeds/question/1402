I am sitting in front of a shiny new Chromebook Series 3. I am wondering whether it would be smart to try using i3 on it. I managed to chroot into Ubuntu (via a script called crouton, very easy!), basically everything is in place for i3. LXDE is provided by default. 

There is no up-to-date i3 build for arm devices, am I right?
Are there any arm-compatible builds?
Is it wise to build it from source on a untested(?) architecture? (As a not sooo advanced user)

Thanks for any Tips in advance!
Jan

**edit**:
A raspberry pi is running just in front of me and I installed i3 months ago. Sometimes things are extremely easy. i3 is a simple apt-get install i3 away. That will get you version 4.1. The question I tried to formulate yesterday is then, whether it is advisable for intermediate users to compile it from source, or if I missed a repository providing a newer version. Currently I am wondering, what size the toolchain will take, as the chromebook is short of disksize (16gb ssd).</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 20:01:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by sur5r for &lt;p&gt;Hey there fellow i3 users,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/?answer=1403#post-id-1403</link><description>As i3 compiles fine on Debian for ARM (see http://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=i3-wm) there shouldn't be any problems compiling it on the Chromebook.

It's also not an untested archictecture (re. i3) as I've seen reports of it being used on the Raspberry Pi.

**edit:** I'm now able to build ubuntu-armhf packages as well. i3 for raring/armhf is already in my resposity, the rest will follow. Which version of Ubuntu are you using?</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 22:03:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/?answer=1403#post-id-1403</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ianboo for &lt;p&gt;As i3 compiles fine on Debian for ARM (see &lt;a href="http://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=i3-wm"&gt;http://buildd.debian.org/status/packa...&lt;/a&gt;) there shouldn't be any problems compiling it on the Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/?comment=1443#comment-1443</link><description>It says "precise". But to be more precise (pun intended), it sports the chrome os arm kernel and is therefore somehow not really 12.04. As far as i understood.

Anyhow: Thank you very much! I updated to 4.5 using your repository (precise build) and it works just fine.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/?answer=5504#post-id-5504</link><description>Crouton project has a wiki and in there a page with instructions on how to use i3 in crouton, the path after github's url is **dnschneid/crouton/wiki/i3** below a copy of the instructions:

1. Install X11: `sudo sh -e ./crouton -t x11 `
2. Enter the chroot: `sudo enter-chroot -n chrootname`
3. Install i3: `sudo apt-get install i3`
4. Add `exec i3` to ~/.xinitrc: `echo "exec i3" &gt; ~/.xinitrc`
5. Launch i3 directly from the crosh shell: `sudo enter-chroot xinit`
6. Create an alias for starting in i3: add `alias starti3='sudo enter-chroot xinit'` to your ~/.bashrc

http://packages.debian.org/experimental/i3-wm

Just use that version or compile from source.</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2013 12:09:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1402/i3-on-samsung-arm-chromebook/?answer=1423#post-id-1423</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ianboo for &lt;p&gt;Hey there fellow i3 users,&lt;/p&gt;
