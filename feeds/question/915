The solution posted here didn't work. After checking Arch Wiki, apparently Qt apps check `DESKTOP_SESSION` environment variable to setup their themes accordingly. In my case it was pointing to path of i3. I did `export DESKTOP_SESSION=kde` and now Qt apps work perfectly, no more ugly theme with missing icons.

edit: `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=kde` works too.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 15:55:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/915/how-to-edit-theme-of-kde-based-windows/?answer=6645#post-id-6645</guid></item><item><title>Comment by i3convert for &lt;p&gt;2015-08-20, ArchLinux, whole plasma-meta is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

If you prefer editing the config files directly, you can edit the file
