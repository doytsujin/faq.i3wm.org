**Answer 1**

I don't have wine so I haven't tried it, but the following should work. Not sure if there's a simpler way. For every windows program `appname.exe` you need to run, create a file `appname`
like so:

    #!/bin/bash 
    # File appname
    wine "C:\Program Files\appname\appname.exe"

Of course, you should make sure that you put the correct path name to your `appname.exe.`. Then move this newly created file to `/usr/bin`:

`sudo mv appname /usr/bin`

Now `appname` should appear in dmenu. In fact you should be able to run any script or manually installed program from dmenu this way. Furthermore this should give a command `appname` in the terminal, too.

----------
**Answer 2**

Sorry, this is also not tested, but I just read the following lines in `~/.i3/config`:

    # There also is the (new) i3-dmenu-desktop which only displays applications
    # shipping a .desktop file. It is a wrapper around dmenu, so you need that
    # installed.
    # bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop

Unless I'm missing something, the above suggests that _if_ wine creates menu items automatically (again, I don't know), you should be able to access them from i3-dmenu-desktop.


So, do the following. 

 - &lt;strike&gt;`sudo apt-get install i3-dmenu-desktop` in case this is not installed by default in ubuntu; I don't have ubuntu, so I don't know&lt;/strike&gt;
 - Fire up dmenu with mod+d and run `i3-dmenu-desktop`; an identical-looking dmenu will appear on the top bar
 - Start typing the name of your windows application. If it doesn't appear, forget about this answer. If it appears, then go back to your `~/.i3/config`, comment the line about dmenu_run and uncomment the line about i3-dmenu-desktop. That is, your config file should now read:

        # start dmenu (a program launcher)
        # bindsym $mod+d exec dmenu_run
        # There also is the (new) i3-dmenu-desktop which only displays 
        # shipping a .desktop file. It is a wrapper around dmenu, so you need that
        # installed.
        bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop

If that works and you want to further tweak things around, there's a program called `j4-dmenu-desktop` which claims to do the same thigs as i3-dmenu-desktop but much faster.

# shipping a .desktop file. It is a wrapper around dmenu, so you need that
# installed.
bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that works and you want to further tweak things around, there's a program called &lt;code&gt;j4-dmenu-desktop&lt;/code&gt; which claims to do the same thigs as i3-dmenu-desktop but much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2999/wine-in-ubuntu-on-i3/?answer=5539#post-id-5539</link><description>the method i originally found to open .exe apps using wine on i3 was to open a terminal and type 'wine' and then the location of the .exe, for example
 
wine ~/documents/larousse/setup.exe.

this works fine, but what i find to be a little easier is to use the pcman file manager to open the folder that contains the .exe, right click on the .exe, choose 'open with wine windows program loader', and go through the installation process. after that in the side panel in pcmanfm on the left is a 'applications' option, which has a full menu for the computer, and the wine programs are listed under 'other'. i don't know if this would work in other file managers or not, or if it's dependant on ubuntu, in which case the terminal method would probably still work. </description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 02:16:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2999/wine-in-ubuntu-on-i3/?answer=5539#post-id-5539</guid></item></channel></rss>
