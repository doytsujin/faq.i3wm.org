Maybe [this question on askubutu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/472220/change-notification-daemon-on-14-04) helps. I myself just uninstalled the xfce4 notification daemon from my Xubuntu.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:31:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5187/how-to-get-dunst-working/?comment=5188#comment-5188</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;I just installed Dunst (via the .deb i found on Ubuntu Launchpad). &lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5187/how-to-get-dunst-working/?answer=5189#post-id-5189</link><description>Here are the necessary steps that work for me:

1. Find out what the default notification daemon's name is (if you do not already know it) Here, a `ps aux | grep noti` might help.
2. Put the following command in your i3 config file to kill the default daemon every time i3 is started: `exec killall -q &lt;notification daemon&gt;`.
3. To start `dunst`, add to the config `exec --no-startup-id dunst -config &lt;path-to-config&gt;`. Leave the `-config ...` part if you want the default behaviour of `dunst`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5187/how-to-get-dunst-working/?answer=5189#post-id-5189</guid></item></channel></rss>
