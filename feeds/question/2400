Would assigning a default layout per workspace help you? There's a script for that. </description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 04:46:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2400/creating-empty-container-with-a-specific-layout/?comment=5844#comment-5844</guid></item><item><title>Answer by peterN for &lt;p&gt;I'd like to create an empty container that acts like an empty workspace so that I can set the layout &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; opening an application within it.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2400/creating-empty-container-with-a-specific-layout/?answer=5841#post-id-5841</link><description>you can save and restore layouts of workspaces as documented on [http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html). This includes setting the layout (tabbed, splitv, splith, ...). Until now I have only used this when assigning the slots to specific applications (the swallow part). Not sure on how it works out in a generic way.

you can also set the default layout mode for new containers like so:
[https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_layout_mode_for_new_containers](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_layout_mode_for_new_containers)
however, this is probably a global setting that can't be changed per workspace

both pointers should give you some help
