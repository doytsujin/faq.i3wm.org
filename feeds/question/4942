On workspace 1-4 one could work without seeing the others what you are doing (e.g. reading the sample solution), on workspace 5-8 you can place your presentation etc. and on workspace 9 and 10 you could do live coding or something else.

Workspace assignment is not what can *possibly* be done, it is what *must* be done. A workspace is unique; it must be assigned to a single display. If you don't explicitly assign a workspace to a display in the configuration file, i3 just assigns it to whatever display currently has focus. A workspace only exists so long as it is focused and/or has open windows assigned to it.

A possible work-around is to either a) write a script to quickly switch between cloning an X output and having two separate virtual screens, or b) pair workspaces together by having a key combination [switch two workspaces at once](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4047/how-can-i-define-workspace-numbers-for-specific-monitors/#4048). In the latter case each workspace would still be distinct, however.

EDIT: For live coding, you can use Tmux with console Vim or Emacs. But then again, that wouldn't have anything to do with the window manager *per se*.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 22:10:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4942/assign-some-workspaces-to-specific-screen-clone-others-to-all-screens/?answer=4944#post-id-4944</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;blockquote&gt;

Assigning a workspace to two displays (when not just cloning)  would really mean that the same window has to be drawn on two separate displays, which is not possible with Xorg. A window can only have one set of coordinates at a time.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 11:47:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4942/assign-some-workspaces-to-specific-screen-clone-others-to-all-screens/?comment=4952#comment-4952</guid></item><item><title>Comment by foo for &lt;blockquote&gt;

The OP wants the same workspace on more than one screen; that isn't possible. I explained why not in more detail for posterity. No WM does what the OP wants.

WMs written for X can't work under Wayland without a compatibility layer. i3 would need to be completely rewritten. FWIW, what you're asking for is a major corner case. Even Win and Mac can't clone windows across distinct displays and workspaces.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 22:37:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4942/assign-some-workspaces-to-specific-screen-clone-others-to-all-screens/?comment=4959#comment-4959</guid></item></channel></rss>
