They treat i3 as a floating window manager. If you go there, do it properly and get yourself ``{flux,open,black}box`` or one of the others, disable the window decorations and enable transparency in the terminal emulator. Real Man (m/f) (TM) do not even know the keyboard shortcuts for moving floating windows ;) </description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 22:21:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3533/blank-borders-around-windows/?answer=3536#post-id-3536</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Man from Mars for &lt;p&gt;I have seem people who have blank area around windows.

Because that's a neat feature I'd like to see, too. I think it helps focusing on the single windows. A thick (3-4px at least) border would do more or less the same, but with somehow less "beauty" (although I don't care too much about eye candy).</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2014 15:50:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3533/blank-borders-around-windows/?answer=3898#post-id-3898</guid></item></channel></rss>
