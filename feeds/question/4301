I can't change window focus, either by the shortcuts nor mouse. No keyboard shortcut works so I can't restart or reload i3. I can still use the window where there was focus and if it gets closed ,I can used the one that gets focused next. If I happen to be in a terminal, running i3-msg restart or i3-msg reload just doesn't return, and sits idle while nothing happens.

I think it's correlated with an application (Newshosting browser) but I can't consistently reproduce it and it's quite annoying to try because I don't know how to fix it once it happens other than rebooting or restarting the gdm service from another terminal.

Has anyone seen this happen, and does anyone have a suggestion as to how to avoid it, fix it, or make i3 wake up in these situations?</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2014 17:11:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4301/i3-hanging/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Sometimes lately, i3 hangs.

Sometimes, after closing a window, i3 hangs, but in my case I can still select another workspace with the mouse.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 19:06:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4301/i3-hanging/?comment=4308#comment-4308</guid></item></channel></rss>
