I use `compton --backend glx --vsync opengl -b` but still get the occasional flash (although a lot better compared to before), and I want to disable shadows. When I disable shadows by editing conf with `shadow = false`, the flashes return. 

*Note:* I'm using Konsole as my terminal emulator (for true color support in Vim), and I've tried almost all of the true color supporting terminal emulators to find one that does not flicker. Unfortunately, **xterm** and **rxvt** are the only ones that have absolute zero flicker, but both of them lack true color support.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2014 18:59:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4606/how-to-configure-compton/</guid></item></channel></rss>
