</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5682#comment-5682</link><description>I am not sure, if I understand your question correctly. Do you look for a way to directly address each and every window, just like with workspaces. Or are you looking for a way to go through all windows with just on shortcut (e.g. Alt+Tab as in Windows)?</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 06:51:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5682#comment-5682</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I expected i3 to provide the ability to toggle between windows as quickly as one can toggle between workspaces. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5702#comment-5702</link><description>windows in i3 are equivalent to workspaces in Gnome. And in Gnome you can iterate to the next workspace with ctrl + alt + right arrow. i3 seems to make you explicitly enter the number of the workspace/window - which is rather absurd.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 08:09:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5702#comment-5702</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I expected i3 to provide the ability to toggle between windows as quickly as one can toggle between workspaces. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5705#comment-5705</link><description>Windows in i3 are **not** the equivalent to workspaces in Gnome. The windows in i3 are the same thing as windows in Gnome, they are just managed in a different way (hence the name window manager). So I suspect your question is unclear, because you are using the wrong terminology.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 11:10:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5705#comment-5705</guid></item><item><title>Comment by faust for &lt;p&gt;I expected i3 to provide the ability to toggle between windows as quickly as one can toggle between workspaces. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5701#comment-5701</link><description>This is not a duplicate. Alt+Tab in Windows switches the focus between open programs. Windows does not have the concept of Gnome's Workspaces - which is different than the concept of workspaces in i3 - which are essentially tmux panels. </description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 08:08:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5678/switching-to-next-window/?comment=5701#comment-5701</guid></item><item><title>Comment by faust for &lt;p&gt;I expected i3 to provide the ability to toggle between windows as quickly as one can toggle between workspaces. &lt;/p&gt;
