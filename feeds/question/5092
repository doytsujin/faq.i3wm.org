1. There is no configuration option for that in `i3status`. 
2. The value is not even hard coded into the `i3status` code, but it is retrieved with the *iwlib* library, which in turn seems to get it from the driver.

The `wireless.h` (from *iwlib*) has the following to say about `avg_qual` (which `i3status` uses - correctly so - as threshold value):

    /* This should contain the average/typical values of the quality
     * indicator. This should be the threshold between a "good" and
     * a "bad" link (example : monitor going from green to orange).
     * Currently, user space apps like quality monitors don't have any
     * way to calibrate the measurement. With this, they can split
     * the range between 0 and max_qual in different quality level
     * (using a geometric subdivision centered on the average).
     * I expect that people doing the user space apps will feedback
     * us on which value we need to put in each driver... */
    struct iw_quality avg_qual;

So unless there is a way to actually calibrate this setting now, it seems that the threshold `i3status` uses cannot be changed.

Of course you could always modify the code and compile `i3status` yourself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 08:35:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5092/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-degraded-threshold-for-wireless-in-the-i3status-bar/?answer=5097#post-id-5097</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;There is no easy way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There is no configuration option for that in &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value is not even hard coded into the &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt; code, but it is retrieved with the &lt;em&gt;iwlib&lt;/em&gt; library, which in turn seems to get it from the driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;wireless.h&lt;/code&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;iwlib&lt;/em&gt;) has the following to say about &lt;code&gt;avg_qual&lt;/code&gt; (which &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt; uses - correctly so - as threshold value):&lt;/p&gt;

struct iw_quality avg_qual;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless there is a way to actually calibrate this setting now, it seems that the threshold &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt; uses cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you could always modify the code and compile &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
