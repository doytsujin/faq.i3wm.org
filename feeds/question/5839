I am drawing onto the lockscreen to show same status information(battery, ...) - see here: http://redd.it/328e18 (where you already answered, given the same username). Conky shows up, as intended, but vanishes for every key of my password.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:27:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5862#comment-5862</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm running i3lock with disabled unlock indicator and have conky drawing some things on the window.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5872#comment-5872</link><description>I agree that there's no technical reason for it unless we're missing something. Just to start it off, can you try applying [this patch](http://pastebin.com/UqBWBw6J) and see if it works? The redraw is also called in a timeout right after. Not sure why, but I've never worked with i3lock before.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 15:13:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5872#comment-5872</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm running i3lock with disabled unlock indicator and have conky drawing some things on the window.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5869#comment-5869</link><description>Oh, you're actually drawing *onto* the window. I misread that (conky's own window being on top of i3lock would be a bug). Is your conky using double_buffer?</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:55:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5869#comment-5869</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm running i3lock with disabled unlock indicator and have conky drawing some things on the window.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5863#comment-5863</link><description>Drawing on top of i3lock is definitely not supported behavior. I think the fact that this works at all might be a bug in i3lock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 09:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5863#comment-5863</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;I'm running i3lock with disabled unlock indicator and have conky drawing some things on the window.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5871#comment-5871</link><description>So it seems the "-u" for i3lock only hides the indicator, but still refreshes the screen on every key(just as it would need to when using the indicator). I don't see a technical need for that, so maybe it can just be optional. Should be easy to patch, gotta learn more C first, though :/</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 14:07:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5839/i3lock-how-to-disable-redraw/?comment=5871#comment-5871</guid></item><item><title>Comment by avx for &lt;p&gt;I'm running i3lock with disabled unlock indicator and have conky drawing some things on the window.
