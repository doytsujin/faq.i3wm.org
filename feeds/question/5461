Today I had an idea about scratchpad and would like you to consider it.
I think  it would make sense that when window is moved to scratchpad it be
the first window it will appear when scratchpad show is called.

The reason is that say I have several windows in a scratchpad but usually I mostly use
one of those windows. then instead of calling scratchpad show and toggling I can also call move scratchpad so the nexgt time I call show scratchpad it will show me the same 
window and I dont have to loop.

The time will inevitably come when you want the *opposite* of what you're asking for now.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 01:34:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5461/scratchpad-idea/?comment=5500#comment-5500</guid></item></channel></rss>
