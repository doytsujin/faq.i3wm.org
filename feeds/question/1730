&lt;p&gt;There is one thing though: When running on battery, while I have now the color of the battery text in the status bar changing to red when the battery reaches the threshold configured, it sometimes escapes my attention...&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1730/warning-popup-when-battery-very-low/?answer=3634#post-id-3634</link><description>Since it was a long-standing issue for me as well, I post my solution here:

 1. Use conky as system monitor. Minimal conky file is:

        out_to_x no
        own_window no
        out_to_console yes
        background no
        max_text_width 0
        total_run_times 0

        TEXT
        ${if_match ${laptop_mode}&gt;=0}
         ${if_match ${battery_percent}&lt;15}
          ${if_match ${battery_percent}&lt;10}
           ${execi 20 xcalib -red 1.1 30.0 100.0 -alter}
           ${exec notify-send -u critical "$(acpi -b)"}
          ${else}
           ${execi 60  xcalib -red 1.1 20.0 100.0 -alter}
           ${execi 120 notify-send -u critical "$(acpi -b)" -t 5000}
          ${endif}
         ${endif}
        ${endif}

 2. update your i3 bar (or create a new invisible one) with:

         # Inhibit SIGSTOP signal for conky
         status_command echo '{"version":1,"stop_signal":17}['; conky -c path/to/conkyrc

Since i3bar sends the SIGSTOP signal to the statusline process to save battery power, you have to inhibit this behaviour. Be sure to use the right signal by invoking `kill -L` (I replaced SIGSTOP by SIGCHILD here) 

Apparently It's mandatory for invisible mode as well (not sure It's a feature or not).</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 11:52:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1730/warning-popup-when-battery-very-low/?answer=3634#post-id-3634</guid></item><item><title>Answer by chalist for &lt;p&gt;So far so good with i3 :)&lt;/p&gt;

I just use a cron job to do a check every five minutes and notify if there is less than 15 minutes of charge left

    #!/bin/bash
    
    BATTINFO=`acpi -b`
    if [[ `echo $BATTINFO | grep Discharging` &amp;&amp; `echo $BATTINFO | cut -f 5 -d " "` &lt; 00:15:00 ]] ; then
        DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/notify-send "low battery" "$BATTINFO"
    fi
