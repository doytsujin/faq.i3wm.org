It is currently not implemented, but is still on the road map. The official bug [is the eleventh](http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/11).

As to your other remark about missing notifications when a window is full screen: Use [dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst). This notification displayer bypasses any window manager, as such wether something is fullscreen or not is irrelevant.
