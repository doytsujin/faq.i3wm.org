I find I frequently need that operation but does not find a clean and quick way to do it. If there is no such an operation yet I may want to write that feature if not complex.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 10:38:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7269/undo-split-verticalhorizontal/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi, I'd like to know if there is a "undo" command for "split vertical|horizontal", which I think is basically to destroy current container and make all the windows in the container the children of the parent container.&lt;/p&gt;
