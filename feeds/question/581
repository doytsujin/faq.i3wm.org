I know how to cycle through the work spaces and switch back and forth by having configured "workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes".
However, I like to dedicate a key combination which will always let me switch to the last used work space to be able to switch between two work spaces on the fly.

Is there a way to do so and if not could it be implemented in future versions?</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2012 04:12:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/581/switch-to-the-last-used-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mmulin for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I tried that before but it just creates a workspace "back_and_forth".
I am on version 4.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 07:05:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/581/switch-to-the-last-used-workspace/?answer=620#post-id-620</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mmulin for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
