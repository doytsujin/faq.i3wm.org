I vi'ed a file last week within one of the tabs within one of the many opened terminals. I'm sure it resides on one of my workspaces on one of my monitors (I have 3). The problem is, it has lost. Any idea how to find the terminal where I've ran the vi editor?

I can see the vi process in the list of processes (ps), so I know the pid. Any way how to find the workspace on which I've forgotten a process with the given pid?

thx
