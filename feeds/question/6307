I have been looking around for a while but I really dont find any solution to this problem:

I just installed i3 on a Debian-based distribution. It works well as I was exepecting it (I already use i3 on another computer on Ubuntu).

But now, even if i declared fullscreen shortcut to be $mod+f (mod is Win key for me), when I type Ctrl-f my window toggles with fullscreen/tiled mode ! I am sure there is absolutely no shortcut using "Ctrl" in my configuration (~/.i3/config). The problem is: Ctrl-f is a common keyword in Emacs (go forward).

I tried to add "bindsym Ctrl+f nop" so I do not have the fullscreen toggling anymore but I still do not have Emacs "forward" shortcut.

Is there anyway to force to disable this shortcut only in i3 ? Where could I find the definition of this shortcut to delete the line ?

Thank you for helping me !</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 08:20:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6307/clash-between-emacs-and-i3s-shortcuts/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

The correct name would be **Control**. So if it is already in your configuration, you would have to look for `Control+f`. Note that *i3* looks in several places for configuration files and takes the first (and only the first) it finds:

 1. `~/.config/i3/config` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config` if set)
 2. `/etc/xdg/i3/config` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3/config` if set)
 3. `~/.i3/config`
 4. `/etc/i3/config`

*i3* grabs only shortcuts that are defined in its configuration. The only way to get *i3* to ignore a shortcut is to not put it into the configuration. If it is not in your configuration, then *i3* is not responsible for putting the window on fullscreen.

I can think of two likely causes for the issue:

* The application itself has a *Control+f* as shortcut for fullscreen. (You did not say if it affects all windows or if you run emacs inside a terminal)
* Some other program grabs global shortcuts, maybe a shortcut utility (*hotkeys*, *keylaunche*, etc.) or a settings manager from a desktop environment (e.g. *gnome-settings-daemon* or something similar)

----

The workaround you tried will not work (or only partially):

     bindsym Control+f nop

While this would (hopefully) lead to *i3* grabbing the shortcut **Control+f** and *i3* would do nothing, *i3* also would not pass it along to any other application. So **Control+f** would still not work in Emacs.

Sorry for the mistake but no lines with **Control** Neither.

&gt; The application itself has a Control+f as shortcut for fullscreen. (You did not say if it affects all windows or if you run emacs inside a terminal)

I've already looked to that part of the documentation and I know the file I am looking for (number 3) is the one which is parsed by i3 (1 and 2 do not exist, 4 uses Mod1-Alt exclusively and I use Mod4-Win).

I run Emacs inside a terminal so Control+f should not be a shortcut for fullscreen. The other binaries are also sensible to the Control+f shortcut (and toggle fullscreen). Exception with Konqueror in which Control+f launches the search engine. May be this is a clue ? :)

&gt; Some other program grabs global shortcuts, maybe a shortcut utility (hotkeys, keylaunche, etc.) or a settings manager from a desktop environment (e.g. gnome-settings-daemon or something similar)

I am going to try figure it out...


*Edit: Sorry for the mistake, after a while I figured out Konsole had some local shortcuts (I obviously edited thoses but I do not remember...) so under KDE I opened a Konsole, then Configuration &gt; Shortcuts configuration. Thanks anyway for the tips !*</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 12:13:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6307/clash-between-emacs-and-i3s-shortcuts/?answer=6310#post-id-6310</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;blockquote&gt;
