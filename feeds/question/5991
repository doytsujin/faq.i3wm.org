i3subscribe window dump | grep -e "^window:new" -e "'title'" -e "'class'" -e "'instance'"
The section after window:new would be of interest.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2015 16:52:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5991/how-to-match-a-very-short-lived-window/?comment=5993#comment-5993</guid></item></channel></rss>
