So this is what I came up with.. Print for the regular screenshots, Shift+print for selection only and $mod+print+shift for the active window.

    bindsym Print exec "scrot -m '/home/user/Pictures/screenshots/%s_%H%M_%d.%m.%Y_$wx$h.png'"
    bindsym Shift+Print exec "scrot -s '/home/user/Pictures/screenshots/%s_%H%M_%d%m%Y_$wx$h.png'"
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Print exec "scrot -u -d 4 '/home/user/Pictures/screenshots/%s_%H%M_%d%m%Y_$wx$h.png'" 

Regular screenshots and screenshots of the active window work fine. The Shift+Print, for the selection screenshot doesn't work at all. The command itself works perfectly fine in the terminal, but not when run with the key combination.
