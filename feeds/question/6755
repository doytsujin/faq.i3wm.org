For example, I have windows open in workspaces 1, 2, and 3 and I currently have a focused container on 3. When I use the shortcut to 'move container to workspace next', it goes to 1. Is there a way to create a shortcut similar to this only instead of going to the next workspace in use, go to the next available. So in this case go to workspace 4 instead of 1.

Then issue `i3-msg "move container to workspace number your-number"`.

(I personally like to use Python for this, since it comes with a nice JSON parsing library.) </description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 03:07:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6755/shortcut-to-move-window-to-next-workspace/?answer=6758#post-id-6758</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;One solution is to write a script that parses the output of the shell command &lt;code&gt;i3-msg -t get_workspaces&lt;/code&gt; to figure out the number of the next workspace you are interested in.
