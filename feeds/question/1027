Normally, I only have 4 or less containers in a workspace, so this is more convenient to press some keys repeatedly until the focus is on expected container than some thing like 'focus left; focus down'...

And seem that i3wm do not have a option to switch to last container option. 

Is there a way that I can get these feature?</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 11:38:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1027/switch-to-last-nextprevious-container-question/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;How can i3wm users switch focus between containers without next/previous features?
