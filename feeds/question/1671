I've installed i3-gnome and gnome-desktop as I thought it could be a problem of dependences with gnome.

I would provide a screenshot to explain better but I have not enough karma.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 16:44:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1671/nautilus-not-showing-toolbar-and-sidebar-icons/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Thunar works perfect, but Nautilus isn't showing sidebar and toolbar icons.

I am guessing that there should be some kind of [gnome-daemon](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/279/how-do-you-use-i3-comfortably/?answer=342#post-id-342) running. 

[These questions](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/346/how-can-i-use-i3-in-gnome-2-de/) also [might help](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/140/i3-gnome3-on-ubuntu-precise/). 

Good luck!
