1 - Keep track where I was in the page (usually firefox reflows the main text, but I end up seeing some point in the page that is considerably above the one I was before splitting);

2 - Redraw the page so the page can fit in the current space if possible. (actually I only need this in some cases)

These are certainly not deal-breakers, they just can be a little annoying sometimes.
Changing to stacked or tabbed mode solves the problem, I'm just trying to see if there is a way to keep it in normal mode and have these features.
That probably wouldn't be a problem if I had more than one monitor, but unfortunately that's not the case.

I haven't tried it, but a reload may fix it. Maybe you could send Ctrl-Shift-R using xdotool described in the answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545117/firefox-refresh-current-tab-from-command-line to fix it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2015 15:38:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2466/firefox-integration/?comment=6032#comment-6032</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joek1010 for &lt;p&gt;I was wondering if there is a way to make firefox do the following actions when splitting horizontally:&lt;/p&gt;

Also some of that is dictated by the page itself (there's some fancy javascript to dynamically change the layout as the window size changes on many of the major sites, ie Google News).</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 06:22:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2466/firefox-integration/?comment=2519#comment-2519</guid></item></channel></rss>
