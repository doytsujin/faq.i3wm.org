I mostly have kubuntu working fine with i3, the only thing I cannot get to work properly are certain widgets (including notifications) that I am not sure how to tell i3 to treat them as floating by default.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6446/kde-plasma-desktop-notifications/?answer=6487#post-id-6487</link><description> I am answering my own question based on airblader's comment (thanks), just in case someone is interested in the future. the correct i3config for KDE looks something like this: 

    for_window [class="Plasma-desktop"] border none
    for_window [class="Plasma-desktop"] floating enable
    for_window [class="krunner"] border none
    for_window [class="Kmix"] floating enable
    for_window [class="Plasmoidviewer"] floating enable
    for_window [class="Klipper"] floating enable, border none

You can also do this to start-stop plasma-desktop:

    bindsym $mod+o exec plasma-desktop
    bindsym $mod+p exec "killall plasma-desktop"

When plasma-desktop starts, a small background window will also start which you have to quit manually.

Unless there is a new criterion after the `;` the command there will be applied to the currently focused window, which might not be the newly created window.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 20:21:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6446/kde-plasma-desktop-notifications/?comment=6494#comment-6494</guid></item></channel></rss>
