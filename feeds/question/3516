 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3516/setting-up-floating-pop-up-window/?answer=3517#post-id-3517</link><description>One way of fixing this is the following: 

You can launch urxvt with the following option: ``-title text``. This sets the window title to `text`. Then you can match this title with a ``for_window`` matcher in your i3-config. 

When this window is active, the normal shortcuts for toggling a float are valid. If you want to be able to toggle this property if also the window is not active, to my knowledge, you should get into an i3 scripting library to select the window and define an action on it. </description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 07:15:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3516/setting-up-floating-pop-up-window/?answer=3517#post-id-3517</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Artifix for &lt;p&gt;One way of fixing this is the following: &lt;/p&gt;

I think the `for_window` bit solved the problem, though the `-title $string` option to urxvt caused the terminaly to only flash on the screen and disappear immediately(Could be a version thing, Arch does that sometimes).</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 07:32:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3516/setting-up-floating-pop-up-window/?comment=3518#comment-3518</guid></item></channel></rss>
