Telling the window manager to move while in full screen mode changes the window that is being displayed fullscreened. This is pretty useful for toggling between windows.

This doesn't work in i3 (presumably because you can expand a *container*, and would prefer to have motions work).

Is there a way of making this work. I can do something horrible where I define my own bash script that implements exactly the behaviour I want and use this instead of the usual motions but this seems like a lot of work!)

By the way, having fullscreen apps in different workspaces work great. Why don't you like it?</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 18:11:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4145/how-do-i-change-windows-while-in-fullscreen-mode/?comment=4153#comment-4153</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;In awesome the behaviour when in full screen mode is different:&lt;/p&gt;

So stacked or tabbed windows will still have window titles. I believe fullscreen mode is only intended to momentarily "zoom" a container without disturbing the entire layout, not be a working mode itself.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 19:44:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4145/how-do-i-change-windows-while-in-fullscreen-mode/?comment=4178#comment-4178</guid></item></channel></rss>
