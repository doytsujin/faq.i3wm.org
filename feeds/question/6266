We are aware that this is counter-intuitive to some people, but intuitive to others. Either way, we cannot change it even if we wanted (but we don't want to, AFAIK).

If it confuses you, just change your keybindings for horizontal and vertical split to be the other way around. </description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 08:20:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6266/why-does-split-vertical-render-windows-with-a-horizontal-split/?answer=6269#post-id-6269</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oberon for &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_the_tree_consists_of_containers"&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; it shows a vertically split container and the child windows are aligned horizontally.
