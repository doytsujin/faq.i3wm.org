The reason for asking is that I spend a lot of my day staring at text, and the screen suddenly going black really disrupts my workflow. However, I don't really mind if it goes to sleep when I have locked it and been away from my desk for a while, and because I'm using i3-lock it is probably less annoying for those working besides me that there isn't a glaring white screen lighting up their side view for hours. And because I use several machines with different underlying systems it would be would be great if there was a system-independent solution in i3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 08:24:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6010/disable-screen-power-management-except-when-screen-is-locked/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I was wondering whether there was a way in i3 to disable any kind of display power management, like dimming the screen, letting it sleep, or starting a screen-saver, except for when the screen is locked.&lt;/p&gt;

There exist enough tools to set it up almost any way you want. A good starting point could be [Display Power Management Signaling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DPMS). To have special behavior with i3lock, I'd just wrap the i3lock call into a script that does this.
