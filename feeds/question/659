 - i3 version 4.3 (2012-09-19, branch "tags/4.3")
 - i3status 2.6 (2012-10-03)
 - Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)
 - Kernel 3.6.1-1.fc17.x86_64

Issues started after an update from 3.5.6-1.fc17.x86_64 to 3.6.1-1.fc17.x86_64.  First issue was that i3status would fail to start normally. (It would start, but with a status of D in top)

Logging into my backup gnome3 session and recompiling i3status under the new kernel resolved this issue.

The other issue is now my system starts up with no audio output.  As it turns out, it starts up muted, but reports at 42% volume in i3status.  (Since using i3, it seems to always default back to 42% after a reboot as well)  Toggling mute a couple times seems to resolve the no sound issue until the next reboot.

Has anyone else experienced these issues? (or the like)  I can't seem to find any bug reports related, or other similar questions asked here.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2012 13:47:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/659/i3status-and-sound-issues-after-kernel-update/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Quick Specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i3 version 4.3 (2012-09-19, branch "tags/4.3")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i3status 2.6 (2012-10-03)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel 3.6.1-1.fc17.x86_64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues started after an update from 3.5.6-1.fc17.x86&lt;em&gt;64 to 3.6.1-1.fc17.x86&lt;/em&gt;64.  First issue was that i3status would fail to start normally. (It would start, but with a status of D in top)&lt;/p&gt;

As for your audio issue, usually when shutting down the volume level is stored in some state file, which is restored when booting up. Since I don’t use Fedora myself, I can’t tell precisely where that happens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2012 17:42:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/659/i3status-and-sound-issues-after-kernel-update/?answer=660#post-id-660</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TheQueasle for &lt;p&gt;Recompiling i3status to solve an issue which was introduced by a kernel upgrade sounds weird, the only thing that might be possible here is that we include a linux/ header which has changed incompatibly, but that sounds weird, too…&lt;/p&gt;

No issues after the last 2 kernel updates (3.6.1-1 -&gt; 3.6.1-2 and 3.6.1-2 -&gt; 3.6.1-3)

I'll update again if a 3.7.* update breaks anything for me (when ever that is released) but I'm starting to think the original issue was a fluke...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2012 19:02:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/659/i3status-and-sound-issues-after-kernel-update/?comment=701#comment-701</guid></item></channel></rss>
