I've looked at the code and urgent only applies to workspaces. May be it's not implemented yet.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 20:05:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4297/purpose-and-effect-of-i3bar-urgent-flag/?comment=4312#comment-4312</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I'm curious as to what the purpose of the 'urgent' flag is in i3bar, and what effect setting it actually has.

That doesn't seem true either, though.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 21:04:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4297/purpose-and-effect-of-i3bar-urgent-flag/?comment=4313#comment-4313</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;I'm curious as to what the purpose of the 'urgent' flag is in i3bar, and what effect setting it actually has.

I'm going to try it and see what happens.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 19:55:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4297/purpose-and-effect-of-i3bar-urgent-flag/?comment=4311#comment-4311</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I'm curious as to what the purpose of the 'urgent' flag is in i3bar, and what effect setting it actually has.

As a side note I'd also like to see background colors introduced in i3bar, although I don't consider them essential to the user experience.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:34:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4297/purpose-and-effect-of-i3bar-urgent-flag/?comment=4360#comment-4360</guid></item></channel></rss>
