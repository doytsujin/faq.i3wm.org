I have set this because I prefer to click on a window to have the focus :

    # focus follows mouse &lt;yes|no&gt;
    focus_follows_mouse no

When I want to copy/past with the middle click mouse button on a terminal for example, the window doesn't get the focus.
I have to make a left (or right) click on it to get it...

Is there a way to fix it for the middle click ?</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 10:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/763/how-to-get-focus-after-middle-click-mouse-button/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by loblik for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
