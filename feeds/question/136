My question is, would it be possible, by editing the config, to open new windows in a certain size? In wmii, e.g., when you move a window to the left (or right) of some stacked set of windows, it would fill less than half of the screen. In i3, it always fills exactly half of the screen. I kinda liked the wmii way, so is there a way I can implement this in i3?

    # gimp
    assign [class="Gimp"] gimp
    bindsym Mod1+g workspace gimp
    for_window [title="GIMP Startup"] move workspace gimp
    for_window [window_role="gimp-toolbox"] floating disable; layout stacking; move left; resize shrink right 31px or 31 ppt

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/136/size-of-new-windows/?answer=137#post-id-137</link><description>This is not possible yet. 

Though it might be possible when making use of the IPC interface (and the scripting libraries abusing this). Has anyone managed to script this kind of behavior? </description><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2012 13:14:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/136/size-of-new-windows/?answer=137#post-id-137</guid></item><item><title>Answer by MeanEYE for &lt;p&gt;First of all let me say I love i3, thanks for all the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a small window matching utility designed for things like this. I didn't test it on i3 but it should work.

Edit: This will not work as i3 doesn't listen to size requests from tiled windows.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2012 17:48:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/136/size-of-new-windows/?answer=164#post-id-164</guid></item></channel></rss>
