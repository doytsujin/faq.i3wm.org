i have installed &amp; use a cursor theme in xfce4, which does not initiate in i3.
if, however, i first login to xfce4, then login to i3, cursor theme works.
so question is "how to get cursor theme to initiate in i3wm?"

    Xcursor.theme: foo

Where "foo" refers to a directory in `~/.icons/`. Be aware that Xresources is case-sensitive.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2012 07:37:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/734/cursor-themes/?answer=741#post-id-741</guid></item></channel></rss>
