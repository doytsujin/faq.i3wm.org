This is crazzy I can't find the problem...

OS: ArchLinux

edit: more info, happens with every font, and font size, I know i3bar height is set by the font size. I'm using nvidia drivers but afaik it happens with nouveau, and my monitor is a crossover 27q, I had this setup months ago and this bug didn't happen.

I appreciate any help!</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 20:43:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4316/i3bar-wrong-height/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;Hello, I share the same setup for my laptop and desktop, &lt;strong&gt;on my desktop&lt;/strong&gt; the i3bar is cut on the bottom, for example, if I set the workspace buttons with the same color of the status bar, but a different color for the borders, I cant see the bottom border of the square.&lt;/p&gt;

In my .xprofile I added: &lt;code&gt;xrandr --dpi 96&lt;/code&gt;

Check your correct dpi for your monitor first.</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 22:10:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4316/i3bar-wrong-height/?answer=4319#post-id-4319</guid></item><item><title>Answer by aorith for &lt;p&gt;Hello, I share the same setup for my laptop and desktop, &lt;strong&gt;on my desktop&lt;/strong&gt; the i3bar is cut on the bottom, for example, if I set the workspace buttons with the same color of the status bar, but a different color for the borders, I cant see the bottom border of the square.&lt;/p&gt;
