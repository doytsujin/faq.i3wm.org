 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3946/send-window-to-back/?answer=3947#post-id-3947</link><description>You're sidestepping the intended use of a tiling window manager if you want to do this with multiple floating windows just as if i3 were a conventional wm.

The i3 userguide tells you how to switch focus between a tiled window and a floating window, and it also tells you how to use the scratchpad to hide and reveal what are essentially floating windows. 

So instead of "send to back" think "move scratchpad"; instead of "bring to front" think "scratchpad show".
