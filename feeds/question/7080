I use a weechat inside a tmux over ssh to access IRC. On my laptop with Linux Mint and Cinnamon everything work just fine. But on my workstation with gentoo and i3, the shortcut alt+a doesn't work. It doesn't seem to be used by anything.

How can I make it work with weechat ?

Thank you in advance </description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:18:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7080/how-can-i-use-alta-in-weechat/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Shir0kamii for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

The default configuration was different from the one at home, so I didn't suspected terminator.
