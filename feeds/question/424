AFAIK, X11 does not send a signal to the applications when the session terminates. Instead, the X11 connection is closed and applications have to react accordingly.</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2012 12:46:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/424/termination-of-running-apps-when-i3-quits/?answer=425#post-id-425</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mmi for &lt;p&gt;When i3 quits, it just calls &lt;code&gt;exit(0);&lt;/code&gt; which will cause X11 to terminate the session (since i3 was the first client).

There is no guaranteed mapping between an X11 window and a UNIX process (there only is the optional `NET_WM_PID` atom). What one could do is follow the `WM_DELETE` protocol, I think the big desktop environments do it that way. OTOH, that’s a lot of code.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 23:23:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/424/termination-of-running-apps-when-i3-quits/?comment=450#comment-450</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;When i3 quits, it just calls &lt;code&gt;exit(0);&lt;/code&gt; which will cause X11 to terminate the session (since i3 was the first client).
