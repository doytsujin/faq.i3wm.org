Switching focus between floating and tiling is done with `focus mode_toggle`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 14:40:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3457/navigating-across-floating-windows/?answer=3458#post-id-3458</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;You can navigate between several floating windows with &lt;code&gt;focus left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;focus right&lt;/code&gt;.

The distance in pixel can be supplied after the direction: `move left 100 px`.

The steps are quite small and well chosen. I do hope this feature stays in i3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2014 17:16:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3457/navigating-across-floating-windows/?comment=3463#comment-3463</guid></item></channel></rss>
