Any thoughts? new question?</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2015 17:08:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6607/when-will-sound-be-included-in-i3/?comment=6632#comment-6632</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;Hi, I've found i3wm to be quite enjoyable.

Personally I find its most useful to bind multimedia keys or an audio mode to shell functions.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6607/when-will-sound-be-included-in-i3/?comment=6610#comment-6610</link><description>I guess what I was looking for was a way of actually getting one of those applets to actually work. Has that ever been done before? I see lots of documentation on how to get it to not work. I'm wondering if there's an actual build that has audio working in some way, shape or form.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2015 02:43:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6607/when-will-sound-be-included-in-i3/?comment=6610#comment-6610</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dd0 for &lt;p&gt;Hi, I've found i3wm to be quite enjoyable.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6607/when-will-sound-be-included-in-i3/?answer=6646#post-id-6646</link><description>Do you mean **changing volumes**?

- You can use tray applets like volumeicon, volwheel. I was using that but it wasn't like I wanted.
- You can use i3blocks statusbar. There is a volume block included in config file like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
[volume]
label=vol
#label=â™ª
instance=Master
command=/usr/lib/i3blocks/volume
interval=once
signal=1
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will display the volume in the statusbar. Hovering over with mouse and scrolling will change the volume. Right click toggles muting.

To change volumes with keyboard you see [here](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/125/how-to-change-the-systems-volume/) and [here](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3747/enabling-multimedia-keys/) but also add `pkill -RTMIN+1 i3blocks` to your commands so statusbar block will be refreshed. Like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec "amixer set Master toggle ; pkill -RTMIN+1 i3blocks"
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec "amixer -M set Master 5%- ; pkill -RTMIN+1 i3blocks"
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec "amixer -M set Master 5%+ ; pkill -RTMIN+1 i3blocks"
&lt;/pre&gt;
----------
If you mean things like **notification sounds** I'm sure it can be done by running commandline audio players as needed. In that case main question would be how to run commands when specific events happen.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 16:39:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6607/when-will-sound-be-included-in-i3/?answer=6646#post-id-6646</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;Hi, I've found i3wm to be quite enjoyable.
