Conversation window on the left of a workspace, taking up about 80%. Buddy list on the right taking up the remaining 20%. These are the rules I've come up with, but nothing seems to happen when I launch Pidgin:

    for_window [window_role="buddy_list"] focus; resize shrink width 50 ppt
    for_window [window_role="conversation"] focus; move absolute left

I should note that the i3 user guide doesn't explicitly say what "absolute" does, but it seems to make another 50/50 layout work for me (or maybe I'm just lucky).</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2012 13:57:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/269/custom-layout-for-pidgin/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by psvo for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out how to make the Pidgin windows into a dock-style thing.

I *think* this should work, but I feel like if the conversation window pops up while you're focused on another window, it might move the focused window left instead of the convo window.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:42:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/269/custom-layout-for-pidgin/?comment=421#comment-421</guid></item><item><title>Answer by styx for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out how to make the Pidgin windows into a dock-style thing.
