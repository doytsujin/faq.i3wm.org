The application should set the correct hints for the window so that window managers can do the right thing.

For a quick workaround (don't forget to report a bug upstream!), use `xprop` or the output of the script in [this answer](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2172/how-do-i-find-the-criteria-for-use-with-i3-config-commands-like-for_window-eg-to-force-splashscreens-and-dialogs-to-show-in-floating-mode/) to make a list of criteria matching the offending window, then add the following directive to ${HOME}/.i3.config :

    for_window [&lt;list of criteria&gt;] floating enable

A list of known temporary workarounds:

    # Eclipse splashscreen
    for_window [class="Eclipse" title="^Eclipse( SDK )?$"] floating enable

    # Orca screen reader "flat review" tool (also disable border so it doesn't cover the item being reviewed)
    for_window [class="Orca" title="orca"] floating enable border none</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 02:30:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2185/eclipse-some-another-apps-splashscreen-toolbar-dialog-does-not-display-in-floating-mode-how-to-fix/?answer=2186#post-id-2186</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;When starting an application in i3, a splashscreen, toolbar, dialog looks odd because it isn't displayed in floating mode.

    Window.setType(Window.Type.POPUP);

This works with i3 (tested with version 4.7). Interestingly Window.Type.UTILITY does not give a floating window.

Note that this requires Java 1.7. Anybody knows if there are other ways?

Complete example code:

    public class Splash {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            javax.swing.JFrame frame = new javax.swing.JFrame();
    
            // This hints the Window Manager to display the window as floating
            frame.setType(java.awt.Window.Type.POPUP);
    
            frame.setPreferredSize(new java.awt.Dimension(300, 200));
    
            // Add some content
            frame.add(new javax.swing.JLabel("Window type: " + frame.getType(), javax.swing.JLabel.CENTER));
    
            frame.pack();
    
            // Center the window
            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
    
            // Show the window
            frame.setVisible(true);
    
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }
