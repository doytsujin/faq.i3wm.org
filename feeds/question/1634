I have some exec commands in my i3 config that launch programs when i3 starts up.  This works fine.

However, when I exit I3 (via $mod+Shift+E) these process aren't killed; if I repeatedly start and stop i3, this causes multiple instances of these apps to be running. 

Is this the intended behavior, or can I force them all to exit when I3 exits as well?</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2013 02:44:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1634/execd-programs-not-terminating-on-i3-exit/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by platz for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
