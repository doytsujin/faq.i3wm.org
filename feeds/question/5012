Can I change this name (particularly the "i3" part) in an ad-hoc manner?

The background is that I often open a stacked container for each ticket I'm working on, and tabbed sub-containers to hold particular detail windows. Most of windows are almost always "uzbl-core" or "urxvt", so the title will not tell me much about what ticket tit is (typically all stacked conts end up named just `i3: T[uzbl-core uzbl-core...]`). I think that assigning a nickname would help me a lot here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 15:29:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5012/assign-name-to-a-split-container/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Currently when I split a container under a stacked mode to a tabbed mode, the container name is assigned to something like &lt;code&gt;i3: T[foo bar baz]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a (unfortunately defunct) [feature request for that](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues).
