A script that almost does what you want can be found [here](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python/blob/master/examples/open-floating-on-ws.py). You'll need to adapt it so that it also reacts when windows are moved to that workspace and if you want it to go back to tiling if it is moved away (and was tiling before), you need to add that as well.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2015 12:07:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6067/force-all-windows-on-a-desktop-to-be-floating/?answer=6069#post-id-6069</guid></item><item><title>Comment by simonwjackson for &lt;p&gt;i3 itself doesn't do this, but you can use the IPC to achieve it.
