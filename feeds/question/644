Just want to know, how to set vi editor working in i3?  If I typed 'vi' in mod+d, the i3 would be kinda crash!  If I typed 'vi' in terminal (which is urxvt), the editor doesn't show correctly.
What should I do to make it right?
Thx.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 14:51:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/644/vi-editor-doesnt-work-in-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi there.

Instead, start graphical applications with dmenu (like GVim) or start a terminal (urxvt, xterm, …) and then start vi within that terminal.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 14:58:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/644/vi-editor-doesnt-work-in-i3/?answer=646#post-id-646</guid></item><item><title>Comment by 688a for &lt;p&gt;dmenu (started when you press mod+d) will not launch a terminal when you enter terminal commands.

I don't know how to say the problem.  When I start vi with a file(for example the i3 config file), the content of the file would not display properly.   But if I use vim in terminal, it is fine.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 15:49:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/644/vi-editor-doesnt-work-in-i3/?comment=650#comment-650</guid></item></channel></rss>
