At first I had a driver that enabled only the Intel graphics, It worked fine with both unity and i3wm.


Two days ago I installed a new driver which enabled switchable graphics between AMD and Intel. It works fine on unity, but if I try to use i3wm I get a black screen that says **The system is running in low graphics mode** as if the driver is not working properly. 

I tried purging and reinstalling i3 without luck, My guess is i3 starts using different configurations than ubuntu's xorg. where and how do I change that? which configuration file should I edit and how?</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 23:09:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6726/why-does-i3wm-use-low-graphics-mode/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I have ubuntu 14.04 installed on my laptop, which has a hybrid intel/AMD graphics.

As this is a bug report, https://github.com/i3/i3/issues would be a better place for it. Please provide at least your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf `and any file in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`, the output of `lspci` and the versions of i3 and the drivers you are using</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 05:43:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6726/why-does-i3wm-use-low-graphics-mode/?comment=6729#comment-6729</guid></item></channel></rss>
