In my quest to make i3 even more awesome for me, I am trying different things and playing with some config files.&lt;/br&gt;
Currently I am using XFCE with i3 as window manager. This is great, because I am used to XFCE and it plays really well with the tiling wm.&lt;br/&gt;
What I tried today, was to use an additional dock (I tried the ones from the title) for some eye candy.

Has anybody already have a similar setup?

**docky** seems to run fine (unfortunately I can't put it on top of screen)&lt;br/&gt;
**GLX-Dock** was working on bottom (then I put it on the right edge and it screwd up. I had to kill it from another tty, because I wasn't even able to open a new terminal.&lt;br/&gt;
No luck so far with **awn**...&lt;br/&gt;
**xfce4-bar** works lovely.


**Edit:**&lt;br/&gt;
As a new user to i3, I am interested to make the most of it. The i3 documentation is pretty good, but to achieve some more advanced/customized experience I prefer examples.
That is the background for the (not so clear) question.
I am (still) eager to see and hear what kind of launchers you use.&lt;br/&gt;
Where are the cli-die-hards that only use dmenu (or what have you). Where are the advantages. How does your config look like?&lt;br/&gt;
Are there also some "klickibunti" GUI guys, that prefer nice colorful menus? I mean who does not like to have a nice PC?&lt;br/&gt;
Of course I also like to hear from anyone that is somewhere in between (like most will be).&lt;br/&gt;
I hoped to see some solutions and inputs from other i3 users.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my quest to make i3 even more awesome for me, I am trying different things and playing with some config files.&lt;br/&gt;
Currently I am using XFCE with i3 as window manager. This is great, because I am used to XFCE and it plays really well with the tiling wm.&lt;br/&gt;
What I tried today, was to use an additional dock (I tried the ones from the title) for some eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anybody already have a similar setup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;docky&lt;/strong&gt; seems to run fine (unfortunately I can't put it on top of screen)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GLX-Dock&lt;/strong&gt; was working on bottom (then I put it on the right edge and it screwd up. I had to kill it from another tty, because I wasn't even able to open a new terminal.&lt;br/&gt;
No luck so far with &lt;strong&gt;awn&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;xfce4-bar&lt;/strong&gt; works lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As a new user to i3, I am interested to make the most of it. The i3 documentation is pretty good, but to achieve some more advanced/customized experience I prefer examples.
That is the background for the (not so clear) question.
I am (still) eager to see and hear what kind of launchers you use.&lt;br/&gt;
Where are the cli-die-hards that only use dmenu (or what have you). Where are the advantages. How does your config look like?&lt;br/&gt;
Are there also some "klickibunti" GUI guys, that prefer nice colorful menus? I mean who does not like to have a nice PC?&lt;br/&gt;
Of course I also like to hear from anyone that is somewhere in between (like most will be).&lt;br/&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1916/additional-dock-docky-glx-dock-awn/?answer=2178#post-id-2178</link><description>OK. So it seems most of you guys are pretty happy with i3 and don't want any other bars anywhere. Or it's maybe just me posing stupid questions (user serveys, as joepd called it).

It took a while to write this answer because I wanted to test it on a clean install, since my main laptop already had (full) xfce and I then only switched window manager.

Anyway, here is what I did.

- installed xfce4-panel
- added 'exec xfce4-panel' to ~/.i3/config (test first if it runs from cli)
- installed xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin (nicer start menu for those who like it, not necessary)

I guess that's it.
