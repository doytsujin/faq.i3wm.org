Every 10 to 30 days at some seemingly random point i3 terminates unexpectedly, I get back to the login prompt of lightdm and as you can probably guess I feel _really_ sad. 

So:

 1. Do you believe that a H/W problem could be causing this behaviour? I notice that all system services remain unaffected and I have no other glitches that could indicate any problem with my HW. However I guess that some problem with the VGA could crash X and leave the rest of the system intact -- or not?
 1. Any ideas on how I could troubleshoot this problem? 
 1. What about the ubuntu stack that's bellow i3? Could I be hitting some ubuntu bug and not some i3 bug? 
 1. Is anybody else experiencing the same symptoms?
 
I just hope that the time pattern of my free hours (a couple of hours free mostly only during weekends) and the time pattern of the bug's appearance (every 1 to 4 weeks) will not mean that any definitive progress will be made after some new version of i3 becomes available :( </description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 20:31:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2273/i3-crashes/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ndemou for &lt;p&gt;I'm running latest stable i3 (v4.5.1) on ubuntu 12.04.2 (i3 was installed from the repository debian.sur5r.net/i3/).

I guess that something like "question not suitable for this FAQ" and a link would be better.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 09:33:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2273/i3-crashes/?comment=2300#comment-2300</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ndemou for &lt;p&gt;I'm running latest stable i3 (v4.5.1) on ubuntu 12.04.2 (i3 was installed from the repository debian.sur5r.net/i3/).
