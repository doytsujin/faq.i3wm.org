i3 is one of the best experiences I ever had using Linux. 

So I try to find a browser that will fit into i3 naturally. Yesterday I found (see link:[Surf](http://surf.suckless.org/). But it lacks any documentation besides the manpage.

Heck, I yet do not know how to proper exit it!  

So I wonder, what are you using? Tabbed browsers? Something I missed? I hope so!</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2012 20:10:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/349/choosing-a-proper-webbrowser/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder why it wastes space in Linux (tabs are not on the same level as these _oX buttons, but it works nice.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2012 14:52:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/349/choosing-a-proper-webbrowser/?comment=370#comment-370</guid></item><item><title>Answer by loblik for &lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/349/choosing-a-proper-webbrowser/?answer=351#post-id-351</link><description>I've tried quite a few browsers and now I'm using luakit. It is webkit-based, really fast and lightweight, very extensible, usable out of box and it has clean design.

If you don't need firefox extensions (vimperator/pentadactyl, conkeror) I recommend you to give it a try.

And there are some others I've tried. 

 - conkeror - firefox-based, emacs bindings (i'm more into vim)
 - dwb - a lot of funcionality by default but not so stable
 - vimprobable - i guess it's not usable yet
 - jumanji - can't remember but i heard people like it
 - uzbl - more like toolkit than browser
 - xombrero - promising, focused on security but less stuff
   implemented by now
