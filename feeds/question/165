The leftover space is too small to put an extra character, so urxvt is not displaying it. i3 does not implement transparency, but leaves it to the applications to apply [pseudo-transparency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-transparency). This results in a black border. At the moment, it is not likely that either urxvt will fix this behavior, and the i3 devs seem to have other priorities at the moment. </description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 06:03:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/165/how-to-remove-the-borders-around-transparent-urxvt-windows/?answer=166#post-id-166</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;The border around transparent urxvt windows is because urxvt is only dealing with the space it can really use itself.

You can remove the relevant lines in the code for now. Also note: transparency is neither endorsed nor supported by the i3 devs, so we don’t care about transparency issues :).</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:53:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/165/how-to-remove-the-borders-around-transparent-urxvt-windows/?comment=167#comment-167</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Klaas for &lt;p&gt;The border around transparent urxvt windows is because urxvt is only dealing with the space it can really use itself.

An option would be to add something like 'for window [class="URxvt"] sizehints disable'. Awesome WM offer such an option for example. I may work on a patch for that sometime...</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2012 09:32:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/165/how-to-remove-the-borders-around-transparent-urxvt-windows/?comment=174#comment-174</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Klaas for &lt;p&gt;The border around transparent urxvt windows is because urxvt is only dealing with the space it can really use itself.

I just did a short test by using URxvt.transparency and commenting out the part of i3 that handles the size increment hints (src/handlers.c 743 to 757). It works quite nicely.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2012 12:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/165/how-to-remove-the-borders-around-transparent-urxvt-windows/?comment=173#comment-173</guid></item><item><title>Answer by teddyballgame for &lt;p&gt;When opening multiple urxvt windows with transparency enabled, there are regions around the borders where transparency does not work.
