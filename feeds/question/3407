I've been unable to overlap i3bar and dzen2 when both are started in dock mode, anyone knows of a hack to force it?

I've already tried with -x -y options in dzen2 and it works to some extend, however I need to recalculate the -x -y coordinates every time I setup i3 on a new screen.

Any ideas are welcome, I'm running i3-4.5.1 and dzen-0.9.5-svn-rev-271</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2014 07:45:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3407/how-to-overlap-i3bar-and-dzen2-in-dock-mode/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by chilicuil for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
