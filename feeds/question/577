It seems to me to be related to using a flaoting window on another screen, this is totally annecdotal ofcourse, I don't really know which logs to look at since I'm a beginner.

It seems to me to be related to using a flaoting window on another screen, this is totally annecdotal ofcourse, I don't really know which logs to look at since I'm a beginner.

There also seems to be a similar but maybe unrelated problem where i can't switch to another screen from a floating window if i press the workspace next key, nothing seems to happen.

Using i3 version 4.6-1 on archlinux if that helps anyone.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2013 13:09:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/577/mouse-clicking-problem/?answer=3073#post-id-3073</guid></item></channel></rss>
