Did I launch compton with any command line switches -- no.  Am I running compton with a config file -- no.  Perhaps that's why I don't notice any difference.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?answer=4584#post-id-4584</link><description>I had some issues with xfce4-terminal and borders. Initially the borders where displayed correctly but after switching workspaces, moving windows around the borders always looked very garbled. I now disabled Compositing in X11/Xorg like this:

    Section "Extensions"
    	Option    "Composite" "Disabled"
    EndSection

This has solved some ugly visual artifacts I had seen. So it seems one has to either use a compositing tool like compton, which is not officially supported, or disable the Composite Extension in X11/Xorg.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 09:58:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?answer=4584#post-id-4584</guid></item><item><title>Answer by msx for &lt;p&gt;New user of Arch with i3.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?answer=3282#post-id-3282</link><description>i3 is peculiar among window managers in that it is not a [compositing window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager). From Wikipedia:

&gt; A compositing window manager is a window manager that provides applications with an off-screen buffer for each window. The window manager composites the window buffers into an image representing the screen and writes the result into the display memory.

i3 depends on an external application for compositing and Compton is an excellent choice if you want to improve rendering quality or apply hardware-accelerated translucency effects.

There are two issues I am aware of that affect stock compositing. One is screen tearing, which you may notice with animated effects such as Firefox's smooth scrolling. Another is a flash of partially rendered content when switching workspaces, or opening and closing windows. Using Compton should resolve those issues if it is configured correctly.

Compton also has special effects it can apply to windows such as fading and shadows. Shadows don't make much sense in a tiling window manager because windows always take up the full area of the screen, so the place where shadows would normally be rendered is off the screen.

Fading is mostly supported except for a bug with vertically split windows. The frame for the titlebars behind these windows is not transparent. The best known workaround for that is to disable titlebars with `new_window pixel`. This issue might be fixed in a future release.

To me that makes a big difference. Also, I think that cairo switches to the xrender/glx backend for rendering fonts to bitmaps which should increase speed a little.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2014 16:12:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?comment=3293#comment-3293</guid></item><item><title>Comment by eweber for &lt;p&gt;i3 is peculiar among window managers in that it is not a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"&gt;compositing window manager&lt;/a&gt;.

Somehow I was under the impression that a C.M. made everything look better somehow (fonts, menus, content, etc). Sounds like its more targeted to eye candy at the window-frame level (shadows, fading, translucency, etc).  Again, thanks for your time!</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2014 00:27:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?comment=3291#comment-3291</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;i3 is peculiar among window managers in that it is not a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"&gt;compositing window manager&lt;/a&gt;.
