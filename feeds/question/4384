I like dmenu, but I make use of a lot customized character encodings and RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian).  I would like to use dmenu, but it mangles this terribly.  For terminal use, I have to use mlterm because of these constraints.  I would like to have a terminal-based menu manager, like dmenu, or rather bashrun and even closer slmenu.

I thought the best of both worlds would be bashrun, but is not quite what I want as the completions were strange and it runs slow.  Slmenu also seems to have problems with the input I have tried in non-English characters.

So, I would rather write up my own scripts and run them directly in the terminal (mlterm).  Of course I can do that easily, but I also want to have it pop-up on the bottom like `dmenu -b` I am currently using extensively for customized menus and ops.

I found a Github gist that almost does what I want to emulate `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK` call required by i3 (i3wm.org/docs/wsbar.html) dock mode and other WMs.  I modified it from urxvt to mlterm.  Problem is focus is still on the previous app (and cannot do much because of `-SIGSTOP`.  Secondly, regardless of changing the `bottom` variable for `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` variable to different sizes, it always appears to take 1/3 to 1/4 of the bottom of the screen.  Freedesktop documentation (standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/1.3/ar01s05.html) suggests it should not work this way.  Code below.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    TERM=mlterm
    TERMNAME=mlterm-dock
    XSCREENWIDTH=$(xrandr | grep \* | sed -e 's/x.*//' -e 's/^ *//')
    TERMHEIGHT=10
    TERMWIDTH=$XSCREENWIDTH
    killall -SIGSTOP i3
    $TERM --geometry=$TERMWIDTHx$TERMHEIGHT --name="$TERMNAME" &amp;
    sleep 1
    TERMXID=0x$(xwininfo -root -tree | grep "$TERMNAME" | sed -e 's/.*0x//' -e 's/ .*//')
    xprop -id $TERMXID -f _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL 32cccccccccccc -set _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL "0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, $TERMWIDTH"
    xprop -id $TERMXID -f _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE 32a -set _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK
    killall -SIGCONT i3

So is there a better way to accomplish this.
