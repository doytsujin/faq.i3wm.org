After a installing the plugin and a restart of pidgin go to 'Tools-&gt;Plugins'. In the list enable the "Message Notification" and press the 'Configure Plugin' Button. In the dialog disable the checkboxes at 'Raise conversation window' and 'Present conversation window'. Close the dialog and the plugin list, that should be it.
