As far as RandR was concerned I just had one big 3840x1200 monitor, which made i3 work in just the way I wanted it to - each workspace covered both screens, so super+N would change both monitors at once to workspace N

Now I upgraded my drivers so that RandR actually knows about my two monitors, but unfortunately this means i3 runs two "instances" with different independent workspaces on each physical monitor, and it's impossible to for example move a window from one monitor to the other.

Is there any way to force the global workspace behaviour? I can't seem to find any way to make xrandr tell i3 there's only one physical monitor.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 12:26:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Until recently I was using i3 with fairly old nVidia drivers (TwinView).

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/?comment=1664#comment-1664</link><description>but why should I need to use different commands for moving windows around depending on whether the move happens to cross the boundary between my monitors or not. That's ridiculous

even with this command, being able to switch the entire desktop at once to different windows is kind of necessary</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 12:47:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/?comment=1664#comment-1664</guid></item><item><title>Comment by STU for &lt;p&gt;Until recently I was using i3 with fairly old nVidia drivers (TwinView).

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/?answer=1672#post-id-1672</link><description>You could use workspace 1 to 10 on the left monitor and 11 to 20 on the right monitor, then change your keybindings to switch both at once.

Granted, that’s a little kludgy and might not yield best results.

It’s the only possibility though, as what you consider “unusable” is what we consider correct. Switch to another window manager if it’s really a deal-breaker.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 17:07:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/?answer=1672#post-id-1672</guid></item></channel></rss>
