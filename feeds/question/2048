Liked this feature in wmii, which is where i3 comes from. So far did not find a link to the main developer saying this, but I remember that this feature was willingly not implemented. One X-Application, one window. Sounds like a solid design to me. </description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 22:19:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2048/how-do-you-display-a-container-in-multiple-workspaces-simultaneously/?answer=2058#post-id-2058</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;No, afaik this is not possible.
