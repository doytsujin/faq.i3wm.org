You cannot without changing the source code.

----

The position of the `i3-input` window is hardcoded to geometry `500x(fontheight+8)+50+50`. That means upper left corner of the virtual screen spanning all displays. There are no configuration or command line options that allow changing that.

As far as I can tell, it is not mapped in the i3 window tree (`i3-msg -t get_tree`). Therefore it cannot be moved to a specific workspace or output with i3 commands. It even will remain visible if the workspace on the display, on which it is displayed, is changed.

While the window could theoretically be moved with `xdotool`, it does not have a title or window class, which could be used to reference the window.

At the moment, if you really want to change the position you can do so only in the source code in `i3-input/main.c`, search for "dimensions":

    50, 50, 500, font.height + 8, /* dimensions */

Even better would be if you could give the window a name, so that it can be found with `xdotool` or similar programs. Maybe you could even submit a patch for that.

###Update version 4.11

As of version 4.11 the placement of the *i3-input* window is improved. While still not configurable the i3-input window now appears inside the currently focused window.

    #!/bin/sh
    xdotool search --sync test windowmove 1000 1000 &amp;
    i3-input -n test

, prompt opens up on different location.

    #!/bin/bash
    i3-input "$@" &amp;
    pid=$!
    sleep 0.1
    xdotool getwindowfocus windowmove 500 500
    # xdotool getwindowfocus windowmove $(($RANDOM%1420)) $(($RANDOM%1060))
    wait $pid
