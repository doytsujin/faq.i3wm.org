most of the time I've external monitor connected to my laptop but sometimes I don't and the laptop screen resolution is too small for certain things. In such case I would rather sqeeze it to fit in more things. Typically I would like to zoom out Virtualbox window with running VM to allow it to run in bigger resolution while still being able to see the whole screen on my monitor.

I've checked some of the standalone composite managers, but none of them have the zoom functionality.

I've also been playing around with xrandr for quite some time, but it didn't fit my needs.

Thanks for any ideas!</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 00:37:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7111/zoom-out-window-or-desktop/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

The latter could be obtained by changing the dpi. The former reminds me of the compiz zoom plugin http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins/Zoom not the best solution if you like tiling but there it is</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 08:57:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7111/zoom-out-window-or-desktop/?comment=7404#comment-7404</guid></item></channel></rss>
