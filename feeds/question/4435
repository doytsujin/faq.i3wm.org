I'm a bit of a noobie but I'm enjoying i3 so far.

I'm currently using the drop-down terminal tilda and would like to open correctly when I have a window fullscreen. 

By default, it will open under the fullscreen window. Tilda is set to be a floating popup window so it doesn't get tiled. I have the option of setting popups to 'smart', 'ignore', or 'leave_fullscreen', none of which solve this problem. 

Is there a way to set tilda to another type of window that will display over a fullscreen window? 

If not, is there a way to have i3 display popups over a fullscreen window?</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:15:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4435/displaying-tilda-over-a-fullscreen-window/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by niko for &lt;p&gt;Hello i3ers.

You could try using i3's [Scratchpad function](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_scratchpad) with another terminal emulator (without drop-down function) if you want a non-tiled terminal window (See also [this question](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3790/hotkey-for-opening-floating-terminal/)). Although this will still force the current window to leave fullscreen mode, it should be possible to script something to re-enable fullscreen when you hide the scratchpad window.
