I am dynamically renaming the workspace via i3-msg (i.e. i3-msg rename workspace 1 to 1: work). I also have the keybinding to switch to a numbered workspace configured (i.e. bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1)

It creates a new workspace called "1"</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 07:26:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/622/moving-to-workspace-by-number/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
