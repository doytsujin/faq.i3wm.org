If you have a symbol in i3status that always has the same color, then its brightness displays the display brightness.

More seriously, one option, which I use as well, is to use conky with i3bar. See this article for instance: [http://i3wm.org/docs/user-contributed/conky-i3bar.html](http://i3wm.org/docs/user-contributed/conky-i3bar.html). If there is a specific reason why you want to use i3status as well, you can write a wrapper that combines those two sources of information.
