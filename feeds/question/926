If you are primarily using floating windows with i3, you are doing it wrong, see also http://faq.i3wm.org/question/772/floating-workspace/

If you insist on using floating windows for some reason, consider using this in your config:

    # remove a floating window from scratchpad
    bindsym $mod+x floating disable; floating enable</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 10:52:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/926/remove-scratchpad/?answer=943#post-id-943</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Marcos Moyano for &lt;p&gt;No, there is no such thing.
