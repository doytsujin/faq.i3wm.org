If you try this, you will discover that the app launches in the workspace active when it _finishes_ loading rather than the workspace active on initialization.

This occurs very frequently on my dual-screen system, where I want to open an app on one screen and then move to the other (which is also a different workspace) while it is opening.

Does anyone have an idea how I might achieve this behavior?</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 03:10:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3526/open-application-on-workspace-active-on-initialization/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I want to launch an application on workspace 1, and then switch to a workspace 2, and have the app open in a container on workspace 1 in the background.

You _need_ startup ids to make i3 track where an application was launched. If that doesnâ€™t work, probably the app does not support startup ids. Using --no-startup-id will definitely not fix it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3526/open-application-on-workspace-active-on-initialization/?comment=3679#comment-3679</guid></item></channel></rss>
