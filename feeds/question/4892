bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1a, workspace 1b

bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2a, workspace 2b

...

bindsym $mod+n workspace na, workspace nb

you are then free to assign a given app to a given workspace on the a or b side

You might want to consider giving the i3 way of managing multiple monitors a try though.  I thought the same as you until I started using it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 22:01:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4892/associate-all-displays-to-a-single-i3-workspace/?answer=4893#post-id-4893</guid></item></channel></rss>
