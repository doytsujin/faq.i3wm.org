EDIT: 'unclutter -grab' seems to fix this like described in the wiki, but this will break i3lock. This can be fixed by killing unclutter, run i3lock, and start unclutter.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 12:55:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2008/can-i-hide-the-mouse-pointer/?comment=4244#comment-4244</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Maestraccio for &lt;p&gt;Quick and Dirty: Unclutter

In that case, &lt;code&gt;xdotool mousemove x y&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;x,y&lt;/code&gt; being the lower left / lower right coordinates of your screen is a "pseudo solution". It doesn't really hide the pointer but moves it completely out of your sight. If you are not able to move it by hand, this should also solve your problem.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 09:16:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2008/can-i-hide-the-mouse-pointer/?answer=2019#post-id-2019</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Maestraccio for &lt;p&gt;Do I understand it right, that your touchpad is deactivated, so the mouse cursor in fact CANNOT be moved manually?

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2008/can-i-hide-the-mouse-pointer/?comment=2022#comment-2022</link><description>Yes! That is exactly what I was looking for.
The unclutter option blocked focusing another window (using i3wm, that may have been the bug you mentioned before); xdotool works perfectly.
