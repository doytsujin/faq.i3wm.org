Thanks for the details and screenshots. That's what I did, but it seems to work fine for me except for the misplaced control bar before un-fullscreening it (which really isn't an issue, though).

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5773/can-i-prevent-programs-from-resizing-windows-f/?comment=5777#comment-5777</link><description>I guess this has to do with the fact that i3 floats all windows in the scratchpad. Since VLC is doing the fullscreen resize, it will stay "fullscreen" even after disabling it because that's now just the size of the container. I think both i3 and VLC behave as expected here.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2015 22:55:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5773/can-i-prevent-programs-from-resizing-windows-f/?comment=5777#comment-5777</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;No, this is not possible.

I think there have been some misunderstanding, because we are mixing 2 different scenarios : when VLC enters fullscreen itself, or when i3 fullscreen-s some container. Anyway, here are the explainations :

1. image - i opened blank empty workspace

2. image - i start vlc and play some media in it (notice it is not i3 fullscreened, i removed the header and have green 1 pixel bounds)

3. image - i either doubleclick the vlc, or press my 'u' shortcut, or click the fullscreen button inside the VLC (note: this is VLC fullscreen-ing, not i3 when you use i3 shortcut). Now while VLC is fullscreen, i move it to scratchpad.

4. image - VLC is moved to scratchpad and empty workspace is shown again. Now i show the scratchpad using aprotiate i3 shortcut

5. image - Scratchpad is shown, with VLC filling it. Now i want to see media name in vlc title bar, and therefor i want to exit VLC's fullscreen. I doubleclick VLC window or use 'u' shortcut.

6. image - VLC exited it's fulscreen mode, but restored window size to what it was before it entered fullscreen.

That's what this is all about.

And in the steps i described above, it resizes the floating container almost to the size of the entire screen, which makes no sense to me

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5773/can-i-prevent-programs-from-resizing-windows-f/?comment=5776#comment-5776</link><description>Ok, i mentioned clicking a button in vlc. I actualy set up a vlc shortcut keyboard 'u' to toggle fullscreen, but mentioned the button not to be confused with i3 shortcuts. So again, 'u' is only binded in vlc and only works when vlc is active window, and has nothing to do with i3 configuration.

Here is how to recreate the "mess up" :

1) open a blank desktop

2) open vlc, so that it is the only program on the screen and fills it up

3) now toggle vlc fullscreen (i press 'u', or someone clicks button)

4) now while vlc is fullscreen, move it to scratchpad

5) now vlc is in scratchpad, and it can be shown/hidden perfectly. since it is fullscreen in scratchpad, it fills it very nicely.

6) but if i press 'u' again while scratchpad is focused, to exit the fullscreen mode so that i can see media title, vlc somehow remembered the window size when it was first fullscreened (when it took the entire desktop) and resizes the scratchpad window to the entire desktop size

i dont feel this is i3 bug, but rather vlc doing what it should not do in this situation (resizing window as it thinks it should) and i3 allowing it to do so
