I'm trying to get my Vmware Workstation to use multiple monitors while running under i3.
When I try to activate more than one monitor in Workstation, it just informs me that the host windowsmanager (i3) does not support this.

After some googling, I found this: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/198341 which seems to indicate that the windowmanager has to support the hint
NETWM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS
which, apparently i3wm does not.

Has anyone been able to find a workaround for this?

Same issue here. As workaround us a different desktop environment for "monitor sizing".
Using i3 &amp; Gnome on Debian Jessie Guest on VMWare Workstation Win7 Host with two monitors, the following workflow works for me:

 - start the VM
 - log into Gnome / Unity whatever
 - Cycle multi monitor in Workstation (At this point both monitors are correctly used by the guest)
 - Log out of Gnome (At this point the login screen should correctly cover both screens)
 - Change session to i3 and login

This works quite well, also when switching from the VM to another host application. Unfortunatly the monitor resizing is reset when the host (Win 7) is locked / unlocked.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2015 08:42:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6217/i3wm-vmware-workstation-multiple-monitors/?answer=6514#post-id-6514</guid></item></channel></rss>
