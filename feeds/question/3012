For example, we have root container A, A has two children B1 and B2, and B1 has two children C1 and C2.

Can I change the root container to one of A's children(B1/B2) or grandchildren(C1/C2)?

This is like maximize a container, while still being able to working on it -- create sub-containers and whatever we can do on a brand new workspace.

The reason why "tabbed" mode won't fit is that I want to keep a specific layout while temporarily maximize a part of the layout(a container) and later change back.

If you've ever used "clfswm", that's what I am looking for.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 08:54:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3012/change-the-root-container-of-a-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Is there a way in i3 to change the root container of a workspace? &lt;/p&gt;

To act on a whole container, you might need to first focus it with `focus parent`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 14:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3012/change-the-root-container-of-a-workspace/?answer=3015#post-id-3015</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Lotabout for &lt;p&gt;The way to maximize a container is to move it to a new workspace.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3012/change-the-root-container-of-a-workspace/?answer=3016#post-id-3016</link><description>You can select any parent container of a window with the command `focus parent`.
Once the intended container is highlighted, you can use `fullscreen`, this will maximize the whole container. Then you can use `focus child` to drop focus to single windows (or select one with the mouse).

To go back, you can again select the whole container and do `fullscreen`. In most cases calling `fullscreen` on a single window twice should have the same effect.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 15:13:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3012/change-the-root-container-of-a-workspace/?answer=3016#post-id-3016</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Lotabout for &lt;p&gt;You can select any parent container of a window with the command &lt;code&gt;focus parent&lt;/code&gt;.

Oly when using "fullscreen", I lost the status bar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2013 09:49:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3012/change-the-root-container-of-a-workspace/?comment=3017#comment-3017</guid></item></channel></rss>
