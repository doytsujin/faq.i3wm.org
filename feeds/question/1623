 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1623/how-to-manage-wi-fi-connections/?answer=1654#post-id-1654</link><description>CLI is not necessarily complex. The *netcfg* package (which has been recently replaced with *netctl* in ArchLinux) has a nice command *wifi-menu* that is easier to use than most GUI apps. You just issue that command, wait for the list of networks to appear and hit *Enter* (because the first item will probably refer to the most relevant network); voil√†, we are online. The network status is visible in i3status by default. The profile can be saved (if needed), edited as a plaintext file (if needed), and plugged into systemd (if needed).</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1623/how-to-manage-wi-fi-connections/?answer=1654#post-id-1654</guid></item></channel></rss>
