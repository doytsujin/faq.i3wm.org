I have been searching for a while but I could not find anything.

When I add *output_format = "i3bar"* to the conf file nothing will show up on the bar. I tried the "i3status" command in the terminal and it is returning an error: "Unknown output format: "i3bar".

I just found py3status and wanted to try it out, but I can't get it to work.

Hoping you can help and thanks in advance...</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 01:36:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3037/unknown-output-format-i3bar/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by wraithxiv for &lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3037/unknown-output-format-i3bar/?answer=3040#post-id-3040</link><description>Okay I've got a bit further. My (L)ubuntu repo's were not updated or whatever the problem was. So I had an old version all that time. 

Now it's actually outputting colors in the bar. 

Can't seem to output custom scripts though...</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 17:30:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3037/unknown-output-format-i3bar/?answer=3040#post-id-3040</guid></item></channel></rss>
