When I switch between two windows with no border or 1 pixel border, mouse does not center the selected window. When I do the same with same windows with normal borders, mouse just centers the focused window. How can I solve this issue? Or is this a bug?

Note: When switching to a window on different output, cursor still centers the focused window even though that window does not have a title bar.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2012 09:37:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/363/mouse-behaviour-while-switch-between-titleless-windows/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
