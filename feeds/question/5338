I've searched google and asked on some irc channels, but so far I have not found any solution.

I have Fedora 21 installed and on this machine I have 4 users, 3 of them want to use gnome-shell and I want to use i3. I have a habit not to log out, when someone else wants to use this computer. Instead in gnome I can just switch user and leave all my programs running while other do their stuff and when they are finished I can just type in my password and carry on.

So. I would like to use i3 the same way, eg. leave all my programs running while other users do their computing, but how?

    bindsym Control+Mod1+l exec gdmflexiserver

I can execute gdmflexiserver. Then my session is locked (but I stay logged in) and gdm login is displayed. When now user x logs into his gnome session everything works as expected, but when he logs out, my i3 session and all my running programs are revealed without password. I don't like that.

From google I found this dbus call:

    dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock

but when I paste it into my terminal, nothing happens.

When I add something like this to my i3 config:

    bindsym Control+Mod1+l exec i3lock &amp;&amp; gdmflexiserver 

then everything is good until another user logs out. Then i3lock expects my password. Instead of that I would like to see gdmflexiserver again eg. GDM login.

I hope I expressed myself good enough :P
And I know title sucks and this is not strictly i3 related, but I hope there are some users out there with same setup and know a solution :)

EDIT:

I'd rather not use gnome-screensaver or xscreensaver for screen locking, because:

1. gnome-screensaver is deprecated. F21 has 3.6.1 version of it and I don't know how long this package remains in repos. Supposedly screen locking is intergrated into gnome-shell since version 3.0.

2. xscreensaver breaks user experience? Meaning other users are greeted by xscreensaver which looks different. I don't want to scare them :)</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 16:44:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5338/i3-and-gnome3-intergration/</guid></item></channel></rss>
