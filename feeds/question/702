I took a look at the man page and faq but didn't find any answer. Is it possible to configure a padding where displaying icons start. The icons are small and stick in the right corner. Having an wider monitor screen makes it kind of tricky to reach/click the icon on the rightmost side. Default padding between icons in general would be great.

If I explained to weird, here what I mean:

&lt;pre&gt;
i3bar (complete width)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                            icon3 icon2 icon1 (padding) |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alternatively I would switch to another bar. Did you guys made good experiences with any?

thank you

Using a different bar is the way to go if you feel strongly about this.

Note that the tray icon specification forces us to use icons (which are actually rendered by the "applets" themselves), otherwise we could have used a better alternative  — e.g. clickable text, which would be easier to click.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2012 11:56:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/702/i3bar-adjustable/?answer=703#post-id-703</guid></item></channel></rss>
