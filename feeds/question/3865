    battery 0 {
      path = "/sys/class/power_supply/sbs-4-000b/uevent"
      format = "%status %percentage %remaining"
    }

â€¦and path is also in the example in the i3status manpage :).</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 19:27:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3865/i3status-non-standard-battery-path/?answer=3870#post-id-3870</guid></item></channel></rss>
