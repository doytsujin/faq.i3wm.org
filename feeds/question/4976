I want to use this to display the split direction in my i3 bar as "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL" but have no way to retrieve it. I know there are little indicator bars on the sides of windows that show where they will split, but I find them hard to see.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 09:19:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4976/i3-msgipc-retrive-direction-window-will-split/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;I'd like to retrieve the direction the currently focused window will split when the next new window is opened.

You can change the default colors in the config file.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 14:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4976/i3-msgipc-retrive-direction-window-will-split/?comment=5139#comment-5139</guid></item></channel></rss>
