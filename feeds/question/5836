 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5836/focus-on-target-application/?answer=5837#post-id-5837</link><description>There is, but only on the current `next` branch. In fact, there are two different things:

* [focus\_on\_window\_activation](https://github.com/i3/i3/pull/1613/files) – defines how to handle the focus change request of the client if it's already running (e.g., opening a new tab in Chrome via commandline)
* [no_focus](https://github.com/i3/i3/pull/1621/files) – defines whether windows should receive focus when they are first opened (used with command criteria)

But, as stated, you need to wait for the next release or install `next` from source.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:33:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5836/focus-on-target-application/?answer=5837#post-id-5837</guid></item><item><title>Comment by freb for &lt;p&gt;There is, but only on the current &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; branch.
