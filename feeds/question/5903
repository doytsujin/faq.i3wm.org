I think this is because askbot (the software we’re using to provide faq.i3wm.org) used to not set a realm for the Google OpenID requests. When no realm is set, Google will use the return_to URL, which is https://faq.i3wm.org/account/signin/complete/.

Unfortunately, we cannot set the openid.realm field in the Google+ API to https://faq.i3wm.org/account/signin/complete/ because of two reasons:

1. Askbot doesn’t provide a setting for that.
2. The auth callback must be underneath the realm, and askbot doesn’t follow that URL structure.

Therefore, I’d ask you to use the account recovery option when logging in in order to recover your account.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 19:51:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5903/why-can-i-not-log-in-to-the-faq-using-my-google-account/?answer=5904#post-id-5904</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I’m truly sorry for the inconveniences.
