Yes this was tricky. I finally figured out that I can use /sys/class/net/tun0/dev_id for this.  </description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 10:06:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1090/how-to-test-networkmanageropenvpn-status-with-i3statusconf/?answer=6289#post-id-6289</guid></item><item><title>Answer by tatpat for &lt;p&gt;With the original script, the VPN test is made on the pidfile of vpnc

    order += "path_exists VPN"
    
    path_exists VPN {
         # path exists when a VPN tunnel launched by nmcli/nm-applet is active
         path = "/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tun0"
    }
