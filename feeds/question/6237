I think that comment should be converted to an answer and then marked correct.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 22:27:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6237/automaticly-switch-to-workspace-when-app-active/?comment=6243#comment-6243</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Stephan Meijer for &lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://build.i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_focus_on_window_activation"&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6196/how-can-i-ensure-that-new-windows-dont-get-the-focus/?answer=6198#post-id-6198"&gt;another question on the FAQ of i3wm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes I want to edit a specific file with Sublime Text. I will then open Sublime, and run `subl3 &lt;filename&gt;` to edit a specific file. My workspacebutton turns red, but i3wm doesn't switch my workspace.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 22:16:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6237/automaticly-switch-to-workspace-when-app-active/?comment=6242#comment-6242</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://build.i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_focus_on_window_activation"&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6196/how-can-i-ensure-that-new-windows-dont-get-the-focus/?answer=6198#post-id-6198"&gt;another question on the FAQ of i3wm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The default is to set the urgent flag if it's on another workspace and of course you can react to that. The directive would allow you to handle the initial event differently.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 21:42:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6237/automaticly-switch-to-workspace-when-app-active/?comment=6241#comment-6241</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Stephan Meijer for &lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://build.i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_focus_on_window_activation"&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6196/how-can-i-ensure-that-new-windows-dont-get-the-focus/?answer=6198#post-id-6198"&gt;another question on the FAQ of i3wm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can use "for_window [urgent=latest] focus" in your config to automatically switch to it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 21:27:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6237/automaticly-switch-to-workspace-when-app-active/?comment=6239#comment-6239</guid></item></channel></rss>
