 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6299/repeat-or-history-for-dmenu-commands/?answer=6308#post-id-6308</link><description>The default for **$mod+d** currently is `dmenu_run` which utilizes `dmenu` for prompting.

In `dmenu` you can navigate the choises with either **Left**/**Right** for the (default) single-lined interface or **Up**/**Down** for the multi-line interface (with parameter `-l NUMBER_OF_LINES`). **Tab** pulls the selected choice and it can then be edited.

In order to have a history of recent commands you can modify `dmenu_run` to also save and display previous choices. I use the following script instead of `dmenu_run` (which I named `emenu_run`):
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
cachedir=${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-"$HOME/.cache"}
histsize=50
if [ -d "$cachedir" ]; then
	cache=$cachedir/emenu
    hist=$cachedir/emenu_hist
else
	cache=$HOME/.emenu_cache # if no xdg dir, fall back to dotfile in ~
	hist=$HOME/.emenu_cache_hist # if no xdg dir, fall back to dotfile in ~
fi
if [ ! -e "$hist" ]; then
    touch "$hist"
    echo foo
fi
cmd=$(
	IFS=:
	if stest -dqr -n "$cache" $PATH; then
        (tac "$hist" ; stest -flx $PATH | sort -u | tee "$cache" ) | dmenu "$@"
	else
        (tac "$hist"; cat "$cache") | dmenu "$@"
	fi
    ) 

#echo "$cmd" | ${SHELL:-"/bin/sh"} &amp;
i3-msg "exec $cmd"

sed -i -e "/^${cmd}$/d;${histsize}q" "$hist"
echo "$cmd" &gt;&gt; "$hist"
&lt;/pre&gt;

This saves the last 50 choices (edit `histsize=50` for more or less) alongside the normal cache file and presents them first in order of recentness. It also uses `i3-msg exec â€¦` instead of just passing it to a shell, which allows for applications that support it (unfortunatelly not all do) to appear on the workspace on which they were called.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 09:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6299/repeat-or-history-for-dmenu-commands/?answer=6308#post-id-6308</guid></item><item><title>Answer by biocyberman for &lt;p&gt;In shell you can use up/down arrows to access previously run commands.
