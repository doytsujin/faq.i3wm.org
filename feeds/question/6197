By default, i3wm can divide a screen horizontally or vertically.
With the correct key binding, you mark the split respectively on the right, or on the bottom of the current window.
I often need to split horizontally a window, but not on the right side : on the left side !
I do it classically, but I have to move the new window on the left side.
It's too much effort for me (i3wm makes me very, very lazy ^^).

Is it already possible, with a second bind key ($win+Shift+v for example), to split on the left side or on the top of the current window ? 
If not, could we imagine this improvement in a future version ?

    bindsym $win+Shift+v focus up, split v
    bindsym $win+Shift+h focus left, split h

But it won't work in all scenarios, e.g., it won't work if you only have one window open on a workspace. And it'll even "break" if you use multiple monitors.

As for adding this as a feature, you should file a feature request on Github.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 11:48:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6197/set-the-split-on-the-top-or-on-the-left-of-the-current-window/?answer=6199#post-id-6199</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;There is no built-in command for this, no.

-&gt; I don't know why it won't works if you have only one window on a workspace. The split will be marked and the next openned window will go where you want...

"you should file a feature request on Github"
--&gt; I will :)</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 12:40:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6197/set-the-split-on-the-top-or-on-the-left-of-the-current-window/?comment=6201#comment-6201</guid></item></channel></rss>
