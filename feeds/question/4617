This question has been asked on IRC several times.
I don't think it is going to be implemented in core i3,
but the tools to achieve padding are already in place.

The image linked above demonstrates it is possible to introduce the gaps
(whatever their purpose might beâ€¦).
Note there's only one floating window in that screenshot.

The trick is to use empty containers for padding.
An empty container can be spawned
by issuing `open` command.
As of now, this feature hasn't been documented for quite a while,
so it is possible it won't be available in the future,
but it's rather unlikely.

Of course padding each window manually
is probably not what you want,
but you can do that automatically with use of [IPC](http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html).</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 20:54:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4617/gaps-between-windows/?answer=4618#post-id-4618</guid></item></channel></rss>
