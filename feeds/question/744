You can just run `x11vnc` to share your current X session,
or start another X server and connect to it, for example:

&gt; `cookie=$(mktemp)`
&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&gt; `xvfb-run -f "$cookie" -s '-screen 0 1280x800x24' -n 3 i3 &amp;`
&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&gt; `x11vnc -auth "$cookie" -display :3`

You can use „`sh .xsession`” instead of „`i3`” if you defined your .xsession file.

Disclamer: I'm new here and this is my first answer. Comments welcome.</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2013 17:32:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/744/i3-on-ubuntu-precise-via-vnc-server/?answer=985#post-id-985</guid></item></channel></rss>
