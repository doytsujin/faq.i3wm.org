I have 3 monitors and 2 nvidia cards attached to my computer at work.  I can obtain 3 separate X screens and run 3 separate sessions of i3 using the DISPLAY=$DISPLAY i3 &amp; trick, but I would like to have it so I am only running one session of i3 that sees all the monitors and still treats them independently.  So far, I I have only been able to achieve this by turning on Xinerama and using the --force-xinerama option, but that isn't a solution because it kills 3d acceleration.  I am also stuck using the prop. drivers because nouveau doesn't have support for OpenCL, which I also use.  Following are my .xinitrc, xorg.conf, and xrandr output.  Would someone be willing to take a look and help me figure out if you can do this? I thought you would be able to by RANDR 1.4.  I have been using i3 on my laptop and think it is fantastic, I would really like to use it at work as well.  Thanks!

So far, as I said, the only solutions have been to turn on Xinerama and use the force option - otherwise, I can't seem to get it to work.  Thanks for any suggestions / help!</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:12:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5362/3-monitors-2-nvidia-cards-how-to-setup-without-xinerama/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tenspd137 for &lt;div class="snippet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 3 monitors and 2 nvidia cards attached to my computer at work.  I can obtain 3 separate X screens and run 3 separate sessions of i3 using the DISPLAY=$DISPLAY i3 &amp;amp; trick, but I would like to have it so I am only running one session of i3 that sees all the monitors and still treats them independently.  So far, I I have only been able to achieve this by turning on Xinerama and using the --force-xinerama option, but that isn't a solution because it kills 3d acceleration.  I am also stuck using the prop. drivers because nouveau doesn't have support for OpenCL, which I also use.  Following are my .xinitrc, xorg.conf, and xrandr output.  Would someone be willing to take a look and help me figure out if you can do this? I thought you would be able to by RANDR 1.4.  I have been using i3 on my laptop and think it is fantastic, I would really like to use it at work as well.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 3 monitors and 2 nvidia cards attached to my computer at work.  I can obtain 3 separate X screens and run 3 separate sessions of i3 using the DISPLAY=$DISPLAY i3 &amp;amp; trick, but I would like to have it so I am only running one session of i3 that sees all the monitors and still treats them independently.  So far, I I have only been able to achieve this by turning on Xinerama and using the --force-xinerama option, but that isn't a solution because it kills 3d acceleration.  I am also stuck using the prop. drivers because nouveau doesn't have support for OpenCL, which I also use.  Following are my .xinitrc, xorg.conf, and xrandr output.  Would someone be willing to take a look and help me figure out if you can do this? I thought you would be able to by RANDR 1.4.  I have been using i3 on my laptop and think it is fantastic, I would really like to use it at work as well.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xscreensaver -nosplash &amp;amp;
udiskie &amp;amp;
CURRENT_DISPLAY=(`echo $DISPLAY | tr '.' ' '`)
( xcompmgr -CcFf &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null ) &amp;amp;
( xcompmgr -CcFf -d ${CURRENT_DISPLAY}.1 &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null ) &amp;amp;
( xcompmgr -CcFf -d ${CURRENT_DISPLAY}.2 &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null ) &amp;amp;
#exec i3 -V &amp;gt;&amp;gt; i3.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
DISPLAY=:0.0 i3 &amp;amp;
DISPLAY=:0.1 i3 &amp;amp;
DISPLAY=:0.2 i3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xorg.conf&lt;/p&gt;

Xinerama would work - but be in conflict with xrandr

you can also enable base mosaic mode in the nvidia driver.   Run nvidia-settings - and select advanced button - this makes "Enable Base Mosaic" available in the X server Display Config

enable that and set all displays to be on X screen 0

Appears to be working well - no crashing - can move windows between all monitors /workspaces
