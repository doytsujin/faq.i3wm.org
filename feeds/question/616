Using synaptic I just installed Desktop Ubuntu 12.04 x64, then on fresh system I installed i3. Logged in to i3. I accepted default configuration with Mod=WinKey. Nothing other were tuned. Now when I'm pressing Win+d for dmenu - nothing happens... Any other combinations Win+... are working well (*logout, switching screens, launching terminal, etc*), only Win+d doesn't launch dmenu. I can change configuration to use Alt instead of Win, but current config is much preferred for me. Any ideas why this could happen?</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 12:39:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/616/modd-doesnt-work/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by stunpix for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

To enable everything, a metapackage named "i3" should be installed. Problem solved.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 13:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/616/modd-doesnt-work/?answer=618#post-id-618</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
