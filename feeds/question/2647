The downloads page recommends using the i3 package provided by the distro I'm using. I'm using CentOS 6, which uses the rhel6_epel repo for fedora packages. The i3 package is version 4.0.1. So I tried downloading 4.6 and running `make`, but it failed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2013 17:02:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2647/vim-cursor-is-invisible-on-gvim-startup/?comment=2664#comment-2664</guid></item></channel></rss>
