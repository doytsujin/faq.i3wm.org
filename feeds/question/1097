Also, I'm wishing to change which workspace outputs on which screen based upon the number of screens, but I don't know the X output names beforehand. Is there some way to say "screen 1" instead of something like `workspace 1 output LVDS1`?

&gt; Is it possible to have different config options apply depending on the number of screens?

By using an external script/program to generate your config file: sure. It might help if you could edit your question and provide an example.

No, since screens are not ordered deterministically, this method has been abandoned when i3 started to support RandR. Again, a script might help here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 06:25:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1097/different-configs-depending-on-number-of-screens/?answer=1099#post-id-1099</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Hailiang for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have different config options apply depending on the number of screens?&lt;/p&gt;

You can say "workspace 1 output left" and "workspace 2 output right".
