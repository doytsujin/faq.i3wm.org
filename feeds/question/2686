I suspect that this is a Chrome bug rather than an i3 bug because, according to Michael, i3 has no awareness of drag-and-drop, so I'm posting this as an issue on the Google product forums as well as here; I'd be thrilled, though, to discover that someone here knows how to fix this.

Note: I'm using i3 v. 4.0.1, but at the moment there is no more up-to-date package available for CentOS.

Edit: this happens regardless of whether the initial Chrome window is floating or tiled.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 16:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2686/chrome-dragdrop-tabs-creates-new-i3-windows/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;It appears that dragging and dropping tabs in Chrome &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; creates a new window, rather than allowing for tab-rearrangement.
