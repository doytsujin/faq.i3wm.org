How do I start a new instance of xterm in the same working dir as the one I'm in now? At the moment I created two functions in my .bashrc. One which saves pwd to a file and another one that reads it from a file and cd's into it. I'm looking for a solution where the focus would be on my current window (xterm) and while I press a keyboard shortcut to open another instance of xterm in the same dir. I think you get the idea - I think I'm starting to babble now:)
