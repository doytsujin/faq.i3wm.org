There is certainly something wrong in the way i3 handles windows titles. There are applications which work properly - like urxvt or xterm with "utf8Title" resource set and such which do not - like mupdf or libreoffice. You can reproduce it by opening a file containing in its name characters like "ążźłüäöß". Using xprop you can check that WM\_NAME property is set to a right utf-8 string (\_NET\_WM\_NAME is rarely used). Also mupdf developer swears he handles the properties the right way and it must be a problem of the WM. And indeed. I installed openbox and there all the titles are properly shown. What do you think?</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2014 08:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3816/utf-national-characters-in-window-title/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

It shows the same URL opened in two browsers: with Opera the title is fine, with NetSurf it seems i3 did not notice the title text is utf-8 encoded. I did not find any obvious difference with xprop.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 19:29:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3816/utf-national-characters-in-window-title/?comment=4173#comment-4173</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3816/utf-national-characters-in-window-title/?comment=4227#comment-4227</link><description>`WM_NAME` may use 'ISO Latin 1',  'Compound Text Encoding' (which predates UTF-8 by 3 years), or possibly C-strings (zero-teminated byte sequence without specified encoding). `_NET_WM_NAME` is designed to use UTF-8 encoding. Thus I think the issue is firmly on the side of the applications, not i3. </description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 06:34:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3816/utf-national-characters-in-window-title/?comment=4227#comment-4227</guid></item><item><title>Comment by nilnull for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
