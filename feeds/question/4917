Today I've had quite the problem, but I don't really know why. So Pidgin was annoying me, opening up a window at startup everytime, so I choose to assign it a workspace. I then stopped getting a red square notification ( the workspace's number becoming red in i3bar ). I asked a friend also using i3 and Pidgin, and apparently he never even got to see that.

I resetted my i3 settings back to what it was, even tried setting it to default, but I couldn't resolve this problem unfortunately. The only time I'll get the workspace's number to become red is if I open a contact's window from another workspace.

Thanks in advance for the help</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 00:02:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4917/pidgin-and-notifications/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lasers for &lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;
