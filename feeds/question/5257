I'm trying to get eclipse working in i3 and it's having a hell of a time. Specifically, whenever I try to move a window (e.g. a Console window) to a different area of the main eclipse window, it bugs out by either turning totally black or flashing black/white. I tried in mint and ubuntu using Cinnamon and Unity and they worked just fine. I'm thinking it's i3 causing problems with the way the windows pop-out when you click and drag them to another location.

Has anybody come across this?
