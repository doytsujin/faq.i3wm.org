 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3344/i3-config-file-after-upgrade/?answer=3345#post-id-3345</link><description>No, there is not. The only thing you can track (depending on your package manager) is if the file `/etc/i3/config` file has changed. 

In archlinux I exploit pacman in the following way: 
I changed `/etc/i3/config` with an extra space, so my package manager will write `/etc/i3/config.pacnew` instead of overwriting the changed file, and warns me about it. 

A periodical `locate pacnew` will inform me of overdue system maintenance tasks, including possibly new niceties in the i3 config file. 

I am pretty sure `apt` has similar possibilities to deal with changed config files. </description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 07:32:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3344/i3-config-file-after-upgrade/?answer=3345#post-id-3345</guid></item></channel></rss>
