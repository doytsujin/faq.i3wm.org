The default shortcut is super-space, and since my mod key is super, it doesn't work by default.

I added the line

    bindsym $mod+super gnome-do

to my config, but I have the feeling that all it does is launching a new instance of gnome do, instead of just opening the launcher. I'd really like to keep the mod+space shortcut to be consistent with the rest of the WM. The man page of gnome-do doesn't help much, any idea what I should put on my config file to use super+space as default gnome-do behaviour?</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 18:03:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3754/summon-gnome-do-with-default-super-space/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;hi, I'd like to use gnome-do launcher on my i3 desktop.

In any case, your binding should be `bindsym $mod+space exec gnome-do`, assuming `$mod` is `Mod4`, else you could always bind to `Mod4+space`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 07:11:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3754/summon-gnome-do-with-default-super-space/?comment=3755#comment-3755</guid></item><item><title>Answer by rosskarchner for &lt;p&gt;hi, I'd like to use gnome-do launcher on my i3 desktop.

    ps ax | grep gnome-do

and there was only one instance running.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 17:43:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3754/summon-gnome-do-with-default-super-space/?answer=3766#post-id-3766</guid></item></channel></rss>
