 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2888/floating-to-tiling-conversion/?answer=2890#post-id-2890</link><description>You can move any window from floating to tiled with `floating disable` (or toggle between states with `floating toggle`). You can bind it to a key so that you may change it after the window opens.

You can also add a statement like this to your configuration:

    for_window [title="wine"] floating disable

This would force any window with "wine" in its title to start in tiled mode. See [here](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_arbitrary_commands_for_specific_windows_for_window) and [here](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_list_of_commands) for more information on how to use window criteria. You can use `xprop` or `xwininfo` to get additional information about windows (class, window_role)</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 10:23:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2888/floating-to-tiling-conversion/?answer=2890#post-id-2890</guid></item></channel></rss>
