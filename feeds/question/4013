* ynimous' solution (without window 5) creates a row-wise layout, ie. if you focus window 3 and execute a `focus parent` you get the row holding 3 and 4
* ANOKNUSA's solution creates a column-wise layout, that is by focusing window 3 and executing a `focus parent` you get the column with 1 and 3

Use whatever seems better to you. Personally I like the first approach better since it comes with less keyboard action (depending on which window you are starting in; worst case: 8 key combinations vs. 12)</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 08:36:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?answer=4022#post-id-4022</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Just to sum up both answers: They are both working but there is a difference in the resulting layout tree:&lt;/p&gt;

Worst case would be I have window 4 focused, so using just keyboard I need three times `move left` to get there.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2014 11:28:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4028#comment-4028</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;Just to sum up both answers: They are both working but there is a difference in the resulting layout tree:&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4024#comment-4024</link><description>How did you quantify that? What's the "worst case" you're referring to? I'm just curious, I'm not looking for a debate here. ;) It's just that there are several variables to account for, and I can't think one way would be quantifiably "simpler" than the other.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 14:10:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4024#comment-4024</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Just to sum up both answers: They are both working but there is a difference in the resulting layout tree:&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4029#comment-4029</link><description>You're right, though to be fair that assumes the windows are always in the same order from the start and you care about what order they end up in. It's probably moot now though; with the new layout saving feature, a script can do it all in one keystroke.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2014 19:53:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4029#comment-4029</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ynimous for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to reach, say, from this arrangement:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?answer=4014#post-id-4014</link><description>One solution I found is:

    focus 3
    move down
    splith
    create new window (say 5)
    focus 4
    move down
    close window 5

Maybe there is another one which does not require opening a new window?

Without splith I also get you 3-row-layout, but with splith I get exactly what you want</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2014 11:54:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4017#comment-4017</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ynimous for &lt;p&gt;One solution I found is:&lt;/p&gt;

For me this sequence results into three rows: i) |1|2|, ii) |4| iii) |3| That is, when window 4 is moved down it is not merged down it creates another container that includes only 4.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2014 06:10:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?comment=4016#comment-4016</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ynimous for &lt;p&gt;One solution I found is:&lt;/p&gt;

You can split a container vertically, then move the window next to it into the newly split container. Open four windows, split the first and second, and move the third and fourth into them as desired.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 05:06:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4013/2x2-window-arrangment/?answer=4020#post-id-4020</guid></item></channel></rss>
