    for_window [criteria] action runs action on all new windows that meet criteria

example `for_window [window_role="^splash$"] border 1pixel` may do it if not the entire list of criteria is available at 

http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#command_criteria

to find out the criteria for a given window you may run xprop from the terminal and click on said window and examine the output.  This will tell you what criteria you want to match on.  Note ^foo means starts with foo and foo$ means ends in foo.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2014 05:40:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4627/disable-border-only-for-splash-screens/?answer=4628#post-id-4628</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;The command to change the border to a thin line around the window is border 1pixel&lt;/p&gt;

Patches for that would be accepted, though.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 06:19:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4627/disable-border-only-for-splash-screens/?comment=4651#comment-4651</guid></item></channel></rss>
