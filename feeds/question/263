 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/263/problem-with-slow-keys/?answer=3580#post-id-3580</link><description>I have switched to kdm from gdm3. But from my notes (I have no way to test it) it seems that command `xkbset -a` fixed the issue temporarily. To disable toggling by holding shift for 10s you have to change the value of the key `/apps/gdm/simple-greeter/settings-manager-plugins/a11y-keyboard/active` to `false`. You can do it for example using gconf-editor or by running command:

    gconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/settings-manager-plugins/a11y-keyboard/active false

To check the current value run:

    gconftool-2 -g /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/settings-manager-plugins/a11y-keyboard/active

Note that this is tested some time ago - I am not sure it still works.
