In i3, sound can't play out of my built-in speakers. If I plug in headphones, sound plays fine there.

I'm going to guess Ubuntu sets some special Pulseaudio settings when Unity is launched (like for volume control through a system tray icon or some such), and those settings are absent without Unity. Check your PA configuration.</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2014 01:56:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4295/sound-not-working-on-built-in-speakers/?comment=4296#comment-4296</guid></item><item><title>Answer by chinstorff for &lt;p&gt;I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.
