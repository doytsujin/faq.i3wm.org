Although I know i3 is targeted for experienced Linux users, which I'm not at this time (but I try as much as I can to educate myself about Linux). After seeing some vids and screenshots of i3, I become very interested in tiling window manager, particularly in i3, which I would like to give it a try. 

At this moment, I have managed to get i3 working on my Ubuntu 13.10 server (without desktop environment)

I also try to do as much as possible through the command line. There are also GUI apps which I can't live without, like the web browser, and LibreOffice, etc. 

However, the GUI apps are not looking quite polished. Are there any methods to get GUI apps look more prettier? </description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 23:17:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3226/are-there-any-methods-to-get-gui-apps-look-more-prettier/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;Newbie here.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3226/are-there-any-methods-to-get-gui-apps-look-more-prettier/?comment=3236#comment-3236</link><description>That is a good question. Actually I do not know the proper answer. On my ArchLinux I did not have to download any specific packages, but that might as well be because I already got it. I would say you will should try installing gtk (if not already present) and see what is missing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2014 22:19:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3226/are-there-any-methods-to-get-gui-apps-look-more-prettier/?comment=3236#comment-3236</guid></item><item><title>Comment by idontknow for &lt;p&gt;You can take a look at &lt;a href="https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2974/how-to-use-gtk-themes-with-i3/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to set gtk themes 'the hard way' or just use lxappearance (like lasers said)  to go the easy path.&lt;/p&gt;
