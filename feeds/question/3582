I would like to switch between gnome and i3 (in both ways) with a keyboard shortcut.


For the transition gnome -&gt; i3 :
A script binded to a shortcut should work
I've seen some commands like : startx i3 to run i3 from command line but an error occur because a Window Manager is still running.
I think I need to properly close gnome before but I don't know how

For the transition i3 -&gt; gnome : 
A script run by a shortcut configured in the i3 config file could do the trick.
But I don't really know how to close i3 from a command line.

Thanks for your help!</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 10:27:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3582/quick-switch-between-i3-and-gnome-by-keyboard-shortcuts/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
