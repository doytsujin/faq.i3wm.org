Is anybody using i3 with alternative keyboard layouts, e.g. neo2? I’d like to use the „win“ (Mod 4) key for i3 actions, but I just can’t set it up correctly.
I’m so sorry, clearly an user error, it is working, awesome.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 15:19:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1561/config-for-neo2-keyboard-layout/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi there!

The wizard (when you don’t have a config file) even asks you whether to use Mod1 or Mod4 and generates a configfile accordingly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 15:22:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1561/config-for-neo2-keyboard-layout/?comment=1562#comment-1562</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi there!

How did you try to set up Mod4 usage? Could you please link to your configuration or post at least part of it? </description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 09:54:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1561/config-for-neo2-keyboard-layout/?comment=4940#comment-4940</guid></item><item><title>Answer by peterN for &lt;p&gt;Hi there!

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1561/config-for-neo2-keyboard-layout/?answer=4939#post-id-4939</link><description>Hi, I am using neo2 with i3wm without any glitches! How do you setup/use neo2? Which distribution do you use? On debian testing/unstable I switched the whole system to use neo2 by default by adapting /etc/default/keyboard like this

    # /etc/default/keyboard switch system to neo2 layout
    XKBMODEL="pc105"
    XKBLAYOUT="de"
    XKBVARIANT="neo"
    #XKBOPTIONS="lv3:ralt_alt"
    XKBOPTIONS=""

running the setup wizard of i3wm created a config file which was adapted to neo2 layout. That is it uses the same physical keys as the i3wm default by using the symbols/characters that neo2 has assigned to the physical keys.

    # ~/.i3/config
    set $mod Mod4
    ...
    bindsym $mod+v layout tabbed
