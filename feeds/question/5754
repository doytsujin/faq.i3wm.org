[resolved - stupid user]</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5754/new-windows-are-borderless-on-fresh-install-resolved-stupid-user/</link><description>Which is not what I'd like. 
I've had this on every newinstall of i3.
I've just got a new install of xubuntu (14.10) and copied the working config (14.04) over - no borders at all.
I've tried most of the permutations of `new_window` and `new_float` as per the manual:
`normal|1pixel|none|pixel`

If I set it with a tab, then to one pixel using the keybind, it's fine. But get wiped as soon as I re-load the config. 
I don't see anyone else with this problem. So I'm assuming it's me?


EDIT: Yes it was me, I noticed that other windows (I only tend to have a browser and term windows open) had full decorations and were looking fine. 
Turns out the terminal emulator I am using had 'no windecs' enabled, so I enabled them and all is fine. :)
