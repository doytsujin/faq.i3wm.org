I'm using I3bar with Conky as status command. Everything works as expected. 

How would I go about moving the whole status bar a bit to the left? Is it possible to specify X and Y positions with i3bar+conky?

I do not know what capabilities conky has to move things around, but the following wrapper script should do as a workaround

    #!/bin/sh
    conky | while :
    do
        read line
        echo "$line  " || exit 1
    done

This just adds two spaces on the right. The script is inspired by (ripped off) the instructions for using external commands in the `i3status` manpage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 09:34:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5031/i3bar-conky-is-positioning-the-output-possible/?answer=5032#post-id-5032</guid></item><item><title>Answer by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

    ,{ \
      "full_text": "Last Element", \
      "separator": false, \
      "separator_block_width": 50 \
    } \
    ,{ \
      "full_text": "" \
    } \

The `50` will change the widht of the gap to the right. Of course, instead of using `separator_block_width` you can also just use spaces in the dummy element's `full_text` property. You'll still need `separator: false`, though.

One advantage to is that you don't need another shell level in your chain.

By the way: the `\` are used to turn the JSON into one physical line which improves the performance of `i3bar`'s parsing by quite a bit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 16:08:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5031/i3bar-conky-is-positioning-the-output-possible/?answer=5034#post-id-5034</guid></item></channel></rss>
