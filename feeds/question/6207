Is there any way to turn off this "feature"? I'm not finding anything in the amdcccle "catalyst control center" app.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 23:11:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6207/how-to-stop-windows-moving-away-from-closed-monitor/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cataclysmic for &lt;p&gt;I replaced an older Nvidia graphics card with a new AMD Radeon card, in a two monitor setup.

Apparently hotplugging and automatic detection does not work for me. Using the intel graphics card with xinerama option.

Any how, I manually extend my monitor to the second one using xrandr.
Once unplugged however, the 'virtual' monitor stays where it is. and does not move the workspaces to the left active screen.

    xrandr --output VGA1 --auto --right-of LVDS1

Maybe that helps you.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2015 07:03:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6207/how-to-stop-windows-moving-away-from-closed-monitor/?answer=6216#post-id-6216</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I replaced an older Nvidia graphics card with a new AMD Radeon card, in a two monitor setup.

But since i3 doesn't move individual windows in this case but rather entire workspaces, you can just move entered workspaces back instead of individual windows.  </description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 05:07:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6207/how-to-stop-windows-moving-away-from-closed-monitor/?answer=6208#post-id-6208</guid></item></channel></rss>
