# Sample case

I have a console opened in workspace #1. I have an application opened in workplace #2. If while in workspace #1, from the keyboard I do `$mod+2` and `$mod` for me is the Win‑key, I'm switching to workplace #2, as expected.

If while in workplace #1, from the console I do `xdotool key Super+2`, instead of switching to workplace #2, the current window is moved to workplace #2 and I stay in workplace #1, like if I did `shit+$mod+2` instead of `$mod+2`.

I tried with `Meta` instead of `Super`, but it does not work neither, and displays an `(arg: 2):` on the terminal, which I don't know what it is. I tried `Mod4`, but xdotool complains it does not know what it is. I don't know any other name except Super or Meta or Mod4, for the Win‑key.

# My question

Is this an issue with i3wm or an issue with xdotool? How do I properly use xdotool to send keystrokes involving the `$mod` key which i3wm properly recognizes or properly receives?

I'v made some other tests, and if I do `xdotool key Super+Eacute`, I go to workplace #2, because “é” is the letter I get if I press the “2” key without pressing Shift. P.S. I posted something on the xdotool-users groups, and will report any useful answer here.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:19:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1548/how-to-use-mod4-with-xdotool-and-i3wm/?comment=1554#comment-1554</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Hibou57 for &lt;p&gt;Note: I don't know if my issue is finally with i3wm or with xdotool.

A possible solution would be to be able to ask xdotool to send key‑code instead of key‑symbols, but I don't know how to do this. However, after some testing, I was able to switch to workplace #2 running `xdotool key "Super+Eacute"` instead of `xdotool key "Super+2"`, this is dependant on my keyboard layout.

I will update this answer as soon as I get a better (keyboard layout independent) method.

Note this apply with other things too: `xdotool key "Super+J"` do the same as `xdotool key "Shit+Super+J"`, and `xdotool key "Super+j"` with a lower‑case “j” has to be used to go to left.
