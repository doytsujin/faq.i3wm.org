I reckon some already do that by default (some configuration windows) and others don't. 

One classic example here is maybe nautilus "File Operations" window, which shows up when you are copying or moving files in your file system. 

The xprop command returns:

    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "file_progress", "Nautilus"

To make it be floating by default, I append to the .i3/config file:

    for_window [class="Nautilus" instance="file_progress"] floating enable

But, is there any other way? I was wondering what would be the criteria to decide whether to display it floating or not. Meaning, I would not want to keep doing this to every window that wrongfully (well, maybe this is just my perspective) goes tiled instead of floated.

Any ideas?</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2012 09:28:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/61/forcing-windows-as-always-floating/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to force specific windows to be always floating?

In case you feel that this window should not ever be tiling (in your case it seems to be a popup window indicating some progress), you could file a bugreport for the program you are using and tell them to set the correct window type on that window.

I will try to push this to applications and see what happens! :-)

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/61/forcing-windows-as-always-floating/?answer=1377#post-id-1377</link><description>If you want to float everything by default, you can set it like this:

    # force floating for all new windows
    for_window [class="[.]*"] floating enable

I know, this is against the principles of a tiling WM. But some guys may like to manually add their windows to the tree.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:04:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/61/forcing-windows-as-always-floating/?answer=1377#post-id-1377</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Dave Cohen for &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to force specific windows to be always floating?

    # browser pop-ups
    for_window [window_role="pop-up"] floating enable
