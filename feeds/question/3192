I have this in my config:

    new_float normal 4
    new_window normal 1

But it doesn't work as expected. Both floating and normal windows have **normal 1** border in that case. If I swap these two lines in my config, both floating and normal windows will have **normal 4** border. 

Am I missing something?

__UPDATE:__
This bug was fixed in 4.8 version. Part from the changelog:
