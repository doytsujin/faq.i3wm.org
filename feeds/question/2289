Also note that there is a light blue line at the bottom or at the right of the current window (depending on the orientation of your split) that will show up to indicate that your window was split and new windows will be opened where the line is.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2013 15:31:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2289/splitting-does-not-seem-to-do-anything/?answer=2291#post-id-2291</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kratisto for &lt;p&gt;The effects of a split will only be visible after you open a new window.
