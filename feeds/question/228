See http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html. It certainly won’t be introduced as a feature in i3 itself :).

In general, I’d recommend not using apps which don’t properly behave, like Adobe Reader. There are plenty more PDF readers out there which are FOSS and open one window per PDF, so that you won’t have that specific problem anymore.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2012 20:31:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/228/how-do-i-find-an-app-buried-in-some-workspace-by-its-title/?answer=229#post-id-229</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;You can solve that with a script using the IPC interface.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/228/how-do-i-find-an-app-buried-in-some-workspace-by-its-title/?answer=517#post-id-517</link><description>&lt;s&gt;Just ran across [simpleswitcher](https://github.com/seanpringle/simpleswitcher), which does exactly what it needs to do. It asks the available windows directly from Xorg, which happens to be a lot faster than i3-py / IPC. 

Arch-users can try it without thinking with [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=60424). &lt;/s&gt;

**Edit:** Should test stuff a bit longer before telling about it. 
What works is to get a list of open windows on the current workspace, when asking for open windows on all workspaces. Using it to find on which workspace an app is buried, does not work. simpleswitcher relies on some EWM-Hints that are as yet not implemented in i3, and they are according to Michael not trivial to implement. 

**EDIT2:** Here is [a fork](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/simpleswitcher) that has support for i3. It works really well. Archers: The AUR you should install is `simpleswitcher-dd-git`.

**EDIT3:** The Fork has been renamed to [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi). It is excellent!</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 10:35:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/228/how-do-i-find-an-app-buried-in-some-workspace-by-its-title/?answer=517#post-id-517</guid></item><item><title>Answer by KJ44 for &lt;p&gt;For example, when opening PDFs from Thunderbird, they just go to existing Adobe Reader instance.

*Type a string and the corresponding program is brought into focus;
if it is already running focus moves to its associated workspace,
otherwise it is launched in the current workspace.*</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/228/how-do-i-find-an-app-buried-in-some-workspace-by-its-title/?answer=3413#post-id-3413</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;For example, when opening PDFs from Thunderbird, they just go to existing Adobe Reader instance.
