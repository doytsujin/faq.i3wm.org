 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?answer=724#post-id-724</link><description>There are few ways to get what you need:

- Use one of the available tools like Kumfer, GMRun, Launchy, etc;
- Adapt `dmenu` to suite your needs. 

#Adapting dmenu

When you call `dmenu_run`, it's actually calling `dmenu_path` and piping it to `dmenu` itself. Which means you can pretty much pipe anything to `dmenu`. If you get an empty string (and different exit code) selection was canceled. Otherwise, you get a selected command.

 You can write a script that would get information you would like to be presented with `dmenu` pipe it and wait for selection. This is a bit more complex than using one of the other launchers but it provides a lot of flexibility and further more I don't think there's anything lighter than `dmenu`.

For example, I have this script written:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    import os
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
    
    # dmenu constants
    DMENU_CACHE = os.path.expanduser('~/.dmenu_cache')
    DMENU_COMMAND = [
    			'dmenu', 
    			'-p', 'command:',
    			'-nb', '#151515',
    			'-nf', '#888888',
    			'-l', '10',
    			'-fn', '-misc-fixed-medium-*-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'
    		]
    
    # our custom commands
    commands = {
    		'nautilus': 'nautilus --no-desktop'
    	}
    
    # check if local cache exists
    if not os.path.exists(DMENU_CACHE):
    	os.system('dmenu_path &gt; /dev/null')
    
    # load command cache and combine with our commands
    with open(DMENU_CACHE, 'r') as raw_file:
    	system_commands = raw_file.read()
    
    output = commands.keys()
    output.sort()
    
    # create a process
    process = Popen(DMENU_COMMAND, stdout=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
    selection = process.communicate(input='{0}\n{1}'.format('\n'.join(output), system_commands))[0]
    
    # get command based on selection and execute it
    if selection.strip() != '':
    	command = commands[selection] if commands.has_key(selection) else selection
    	os.system(command)

It uses `dmenu` cache generated by `dmenu_path`, but prioritizes items I've placed in `commands` dictionary. Also allows me to add custom commands I need.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 04:20:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?answer=724#post-id-724</guid></item><item><title>Comment by MeanEYE for &lt;p&gt;There are few ways to get what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

man -k is a cool trick (man man tells me it's equivalent to apropos).

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?answer=2148#post-id-2148</link><description>One answer is missing (quoting from `man i3-dmenu-desktop`): 

&gt; `i3-dmenu-desktop` is a script which
&gt; extracts the (localized) name from
&gt; application `.desktop` files, offers the
&gt; user a choice via `dmenu(1)` and then
&gt; starts the chosen application via i3
&gt; (for startup notification support).
&gt; The advantage of using .desktop files
&gt; instead of `dmenu_run(1)` is that
&gt; `dmenu_run` offers _all_ binaries in
&gt; your `$PATH`, including non-interactive
&gt; utilities like `sed`. Also, `.desktop`
&gt; files contain a proper name,
&gt; information about whether the
&gt; application runs in a terminal and
&gt; whether it supports startup
&gt; notifications.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?answer=712#post-id-712</link><description>Thank you, Bruno. It's an option to use synapse, although it's not exactly what I was looking for. I hoped to get an auto-generated (debian) menu in the bar. Maybe by running dzen2 or fbpanel, but I can't get it right.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 22:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?answer=712#post-id-712</guid></item><item><title>Answer by tuna for &lt;p&gt;I mostly use dmenu or gmrun to open applications.

Since Arch has bleeding edge stuff all over, nothing barely uses python-gmenu, will need to port to g.i. all the way. If you dare, have a look at: http://searchcode.com/codesearch/raw/19113255 . That's too much for me on a humid hot Saturday night...</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 21:23:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?comment=2209#comment-2209</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ack006 for &lt;p&gt;I took adeskbar code to make &lt;a href="https://github.com/blastrock/rlmenu"&gt;rlmenu&lt;/a&gt;, bind it to a key and a menu similar to the debian menu will pop.&lt;/p&gt;

Can't get it to work though (Arch Linux, i3 &amp; GNOME installed, i3 session). rlmenu.py gives me an AttributeError, and gmenu.lookup_tree('applications.menu') returns None. Are you running i3 as window manager for GNOME (i.e. with all its services up etc.)?</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 19:22:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/707/menu-in-i3wm/?comment=2207#comment-2207</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ack006 for &lt;p&gt;I took adeskbar code to make &lt;a href="https://github.com/blastrock/rlmenu"&gt;rlmenu&lt;/a&gt;, bind it to a key and a menu similar to the debian menu will pop.&lt;/p&gt;
