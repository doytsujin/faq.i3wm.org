 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1460/i3-over-vnc/?answer=1526#post-id-1526</link><description>I just reproduced your steps and got the following in VNCs log:

    sh: /home/sur5r/.vnc/xstartup: Permission denied
So

    chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
should solve your problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 11:06:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1460/i3-over-vnc/?answer=1526#post-id-1526</guid></item></channel></rss>
