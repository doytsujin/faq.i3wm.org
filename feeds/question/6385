The device i am trying to set up is serving a specific purpose, which is audio level monitoring. I am running into several problems while doing this, specifically because a lot of the tools i want to use are starting itself as a floating window somewhere on the screen. If i force them to a tiling window, they don't scale with the window but use the space they always did, and leave the rest of the window unused. Really, i dont care if they are floating or not, i was thinking that a tiling WM would help me simplify setting up the desktop but really, it does not so far.

So my question: is it possible to start an app in a tiling window BUT with the size the app originally would have opened as a floating window? i know that i can force a floating window by matching the title etc. but that seems rather complicated to me, since the WM should know the size the app needs to start in already.

Consider an empty workspace. If an app opened tiling, but with the geometry it wanted originally, the screen would be mostly empty. This violates the concept of i3 tiling.

Also note that the spec explicitly states that all clients must deal with a window manager changing the geometry in any way. Any application misbehaving is violating the specification which should be filed as a bug.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 18:19:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6385/prevent-apps-from-automatically-starting-as-floating-but-keep-size/?answer=6386#post-id-6386</guid></item></channel></rss>
