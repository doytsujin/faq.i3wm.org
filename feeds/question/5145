A bit of digging leads to commit 8ed95ae58cb371a24214ec0474199f5551829cd6 that was made as a fix to Bug [1182](http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/1182). Apparently, it has been deemed reasonable to assume that when an application requests a specific size, that it needs to be treated as a floating window. 

&lt;del&gt;Luckily, `rdesktop` also allows the size to depend on the screen size. With `-g 100%`, I managed to get the nice behavior back without specifying custom matchers in `i3.conf`.&lt;/del&gt;

__Edit:__ Thanks, Daniel, for pointing out that this does not work in a multimonitor setup. Also, in a single monitor setup, ``rdesktop`` is not aware of ``i3bar``, and a portion disappears from the screen. I ended up making a matcher in my ``i3.conf``:
