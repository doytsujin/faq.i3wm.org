Michael's option is  good,however it  seems  difficult to identify your mouse buttons.Here is how i solved with  some of help:

Using the xmodmap we can identify the correct buttons.
For those with the same question:

*"xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X"*,by default the mouse configuration is :

&gt; **xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 "**

if you want to change or invert left-right mouse buttons you only need to change the pointer position 

&gt; **xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 "**
you could add this lines in i3 config,beside you could do a quick script :

!/bin/bash

current=$(xmodmap -pp | head -5 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}');

if [ "$current" -eq "1" ]

then 

        xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1";

else
       
        xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3";
fi

If you want to identify your mouse buttons copy this in a terminal:

&gt; xev | grep button

Best Regards.
