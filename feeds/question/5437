I finally - partially - fixed that by switching to lilyterm from urxvt.

This leads me to wonder if i3 is not yet 'ready' at the time of the config file to load certain windows. In that context I had two questions:

1. What is the i3 startup sequence and where does the config file fit in this?

2. Is there is anything one can put in the config file to make sure that certain commands are only executed after i3 is "ready"?  Would shifting those commands to a separate script and executing them with i3-msg help?</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 07:46:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5437/i3-startup-sequence-and-role-of-config-file/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Shankar for &lt;p&gt;I have been struggling to get a window to start in the scratchpad (I have an earlier question on this, but can't link to it).

I haven't checked out the debugging output.  I found that shifting all the exec commands (and the scratchpad stuff) to a separate script, and putting in only one exec_always call to that script at the end of the config, worked.  I still don't know why, however.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 13:37:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5437/i3-startup-sequence-and-role-of-config-file/?comment=5460#comment-5460</guid></item><item><title>Comment by topernic for &lt;p&gt;I have been struggling to get a window to start in the scratchpad (I have an earlier question on this, but can't link to it).

It takes it's lead I think from the StackExchange software and communities. And idea is that one **answers** the questions (even if posed by oneself).

So bearing in mind that you actually answered your own question in the comments area of the question, I'm going to take the liberty of answering your question in the answer field in hopes of demonstrating the general method of using this site.

You wrote: "I found that shifting all the exec commands (and the scratchpad stuff) to a separate script, and putting in only one exec_always call to that script at the end of the config, worked. I still don't know why, however."

And with that, both your question and your/my answer may deserve some votes by other readers. And if they garner some votes, then I have a feeling that the contributors' karma points begin to go up. And with higher karma point scores, we can all do things like add screenshots and links to our questions and answers. And we can even vote up questions and answers (after attaining a minimum of 10 karma points; which I've not yet done so I cannot up-vote your question).</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 23:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5437/i3-startup-sequence-and-role-of-config-file/?answer=5465#post-id-5465</guid></item></channel></rss>
