Some things you can do about it (if you want to keep using nautilus):

(a) create a bash alias: 
    
    # add this to your ~/.bash_aliases file

This works, but still you would need a terminal to execute this (and all nautilus output dirts your terminal). So, what I do it:

(b) create a bash script and place it in your $PATH:

create the file, let's say: nautilus2 or n2autilus in /usr/local/bin:
    
    #!/bin/bash

I like the n2autilus, because it is quick to access through the dmenu_run ($mod+d, then type n2, enter, and you are done).

Don't know why (maybe I did something wrong last time), but it did not work for me before. I think I only used gconftool instead of gsettings (the latter is the one that worked for me).

[UPDATED]
Muhuahha, of course, after a couple of months suffering this, as soon as I post a question in a public forum, I find the answer myself. The problem is the new Ubuntu includes a fork of Nautilus called Nemo (just found out) and the config for nemo is different.

$ gsettings set org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons false

will do the trick.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 02:54:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1/how-can-i-get-rid-of-the-nautilus-desktop-window/?answer=4678#post-id-4678</guid></item><item><title>Answer by kenda for &lt;p&gt;When using i3 within a GNOME session, starting nautilus (the file manager), nautilus will also start a window containing the desktop icons.
