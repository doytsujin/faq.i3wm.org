I have a fairly serious issue when using eclipse within i3 that I haven't been able to find a solution to. Basically "In Window" shortcuts (eg Ctrl+F, Ctrl+Shift+R) will only usually work once. If I then change the focus to another dock window within eclipse, then back again, the shortcut key will work again.

So:
Click in editor window&lt;br&gt;
Ctrl+F (works)&lt;br&gt;
Close find window&lt;br&gt;
Ctrl+F (doesn't work)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;...until...&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Click in Outline window (or some other dock window within eclipse)&lt;br&gt;
Click in editor window&lt;br&gt;
Ctrl+F (works!)&lt;br&gt;
Close find window&lt;br&gt;
Ctrl+F (doesn't work)&lt;br&gt;

I wanted to ask here before reporting a bug, in case there was a known solution.

P.S. I don't have anything bound to the control key, I've tried this with $mod set to both the windows and the alt key.

TonyC, you can reproduce the error moving your mouse to the eclipse window title, for exemple. If you let the mouse there, "edit shortcut actions" will fail as described by badeclipse. After that, you will need to click  on another component and then click on editor again.

This is not a i3wm issue, it's an eclipse bug. This will happen in every wm that focus follows the mouse. If you want to change the focus behavior of i3wm add the following line in your i3 config file:

   

    focus_follows_mouse no
