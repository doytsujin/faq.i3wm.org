</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3429/weird-startup-workspace-behavior/?comment=3676#comment-3676</link><description>This is not entirely correct. i3 does remember on which workspace you started an application and will open the applications windows on that workspace. This requires startup-ids to be supported by that application, though.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:56:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3429/weird-startup-workspace-behavior/?comment=3676#comment-3676</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I have this code snippet in my config.

Instead, the proper solution is to make rxvt (and perhaps clementine?) support startup ids. I know that in urxvt, they work (I implemented them there ;)).</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:58:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3429/weird-startup-workspace-behavior/?comment=3678#comment-3678</guid></item><item><title>Answer by gunjanthesystem for &lt;p&gt;I have this code snippet in my config.
