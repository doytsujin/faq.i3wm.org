For example if I download something in firefox I get a floating window popping up that asks me where I want to save the file. But I can't click the OK or Save button. If I move the mouse over the save button and click it actually sends the click to the window behind the floating window. However the floating window is selected and it's title bare is highlighted.  Anyone else know how to fix this?

Only way to be sure is debugging it, hence the log file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 05:57:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6286/problem-with-focusing-in-floating-windows/?comment=6296#comment-6296</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sashang for &lt;p&gt;Floating windows don't seem to retain the focus properly.

I am beginning to suspect that my mouse is a problem since it's a R.A.T. 9 and sometimes pressing one of the non-standard buttons when running Linux unvirtualzied causes Linux to lose the mouse on the usb bus.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 01:18:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6286/problem-with-focusing-in-floating-windows/?comment=6295#comment-6295</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Floating windows don't seem to retain the focus properly.

Please make sure you are running the latest i3 (4.10.2) and file a bug on Github with a log file.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 10:06:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6286/problem-with-focusing-in-floating-windows/?comment=6290#comment-6290</guid></item></channel></rss>
