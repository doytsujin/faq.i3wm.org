So menus (both right-click and button menus) fly away and flicker in some applications like spacefm, gnome terminal, xnoise,gedit but behave perfectly in applications like midori and libreoffice.

When I restart system, it works fine for a short while but then again starts this behaviour.

This is very annoying as spacefm and gnome terminal are my most used applications in i3 and with this problem it is becoming impossible to use them to do any work. I really really want to continue to use i3, as i love it, so please suggest any fix to this error.
