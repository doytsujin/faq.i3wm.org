create a thread that is all about compatible software

So, is there a better way to open a random file, than starting nautilus,
and browse it? Not talking about the dot-slash. The start, the exec, execlp(), etc.

For instance when I choose that I want to open a plain .png in i3.
What would be the best way from the command prompt? I would like to ask.

Also, I wonder if there are any good i3 compatible media-format
viewers (jpg, gif, png, etc.), could you suggest one, or some? Besides the
regular GNOME image reader.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 00:37:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4877/is-there-a-better-way-than-nautilus/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by smlb for &lt;p&gt;This post is called IS THERE A BETTER WAY THAN NAUTILUS, because I want to

I also use it to set the dektop background on my Arch install and it's as lightweight as it gets.

From the CLI I can use:
&gt; feh my-image.png

or

&gt; xdg-open my-image.png

The second line of course needs to have `xdg-open` installed and the correct mime-types set. See [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xdg-open) for detailed instructions on how to do that.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:03:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4877/is-there-a-better-way-than-nautilus/?answer=4880#post-id-4880</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;This post is called IS THERE A BETTER WAY THAN NAUTILUS, because I want to

Read [this page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications) from the Arch wiki and [this page](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Recommended_applications) from the Gentoo wiki. Install and play around with a few things to figure out what you like. You can also take a look at the suckless wiki for a list of programs considered to work either [well](http://suckless.org/rocks) or [poorly](http://suckless.org/sucks) in a tiling and/or minimal environment (it says they "work well with dwm," but their criteria apply equally well to other tiling WMs). Those pages will also give you some ideas on how to better articulate future questions by directing you toward specific categories of software. As it is, this thread is so open-ended that it's bound to turn into an endless, hideous mess with everyone chiming in with "I like *Program X*!"

And the "best way" to do anything from the command line is with the Unix utilities (*BSD) or GNU coreutils (GNU/Linux). ;)</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 18:33:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4877/is-there-a-better-way-than-nautilus/?answer=4887#post-id-4887</guid></item></channel></rss>
