When using multiple monitors, when I open a new terminal by any method, both my monitors will briefly (about one second) go black, then they will come back at staggered times with the new terminal open. My workspace seems to usually be set to workspace 1 again after the screens come back. This is a very annoying issue as it really messes with my workflow. Any help would be appreciated.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 06:57:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3859/screen-flashes-on-new-terminal-with-multiple-monitors/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Although i3 works very well for me with a single monitor, I often plug in another.
