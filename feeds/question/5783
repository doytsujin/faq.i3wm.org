So if I open a single terminal in an empty workspace it takes up half of the workspace instead of taking up the entire workspace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2015 02:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5783/single-window-on-a-workspace-take-up-half-the-screen/?comment=5785#comment-5785</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a single window open only take up the right or left side of the the workspace without floating that window and manually position/resizing? &lt;/p&gt;

Could you be more clear on what you are trying to achieve.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2015 02:18:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5783/single-window-on-a-workspace-take-up-half-the-screen/?comment=5784#comment-5784</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a single window open only take up the right or left side of the the workspace without floating that window and manually position/resizing? &lt;/p&gt;

This is, of course, officially not supported, though.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2015 09:43:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5783/single-window-on-a-workspace-take-up-half-the-screen/?comment=5786#comment-5786</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lunarl0n for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a single window open only take up the right or left side of the the workspace without floating that window and manually position/resizing? &lt;/p&gt;

    bindsym $mod+o open

Then I could open a terminal alongside it to only take up half the screen.
