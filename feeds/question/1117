/later edit: It seems this is also causing text pop-ups to flicker, when I hover the mouse pointer over a podcast episode in gpodder for example. Another thing I just realized, when I select a piece of text (or entire with ctrl+a) in a textchat, the flickering is causing my text to be deselected. This doesn't seem to happen continuously, only for a number of times. For example, I select the text, it deselects, then select it again, it deselects again. I select it again and after that it stays selected. Same with pop-ups. Only first time(s), after first hovered the pointer and the info was showed.

With or without "double_buffer yes" in the conky script. I updated some xorg packages and i3-git and restarted X. One of these actions must have solved it. I can now select text without it being automatically deselected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 12:58:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1117/conky-status-piped-to-i3bar-using-json-causes-text-to-flicker/?comment=1158#comment-1158</guid></item><item><title>Comment by naq for &lt;p&gt;Update:  Get rid of double_buffer yes.

I already tried like I said, many settings and initially I didn't have "double_bufffer yes" in conky, I only added it afterwads, after I noticed the flickering.

So I tried your script and it does the same thing, unfortunately. I suspected it's not necessary conky's fault or only conky's fault. What can it be then?! I'm not the only one who had this problem so there has to be more than just my config.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 15:26:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1117/conky-status-piped-to-i3bar-using-json-causes-text-to-flicker/?comment=1164#comment-1164</guid></item><item><title>Comment by naq for &lt;p&gt;Update:  Get rid of double_buffer yes.

If I pipe conky into dzen2, it doesn't flicker, dzen2 updates it without any flashing. I probably should have mentioned this in the original post.

Try to go through and tidy up the syntax, including curly braces where left out...${uptime}, ${kernel}, ${machine}, etc.  Let's see if that has any impact. </description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:35:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1117/conky-status-piped-to-i3bar-using-json-causes-text-to-flicker/?comment=1159#comment-1159</guid></item><item><title>Comment by naq for &lt;p&gt;Update:  Get rid of double_buffer yes.  That will do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when I had update_interval set at 1, I also got flickering.  However, when I changed to 2 the flickering was gone.  What value are you using?  Can you confirm with a value of 2, possibly even higher, like 3, you are still having flickering problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue you describe, I am not sure.  A bit difficult to follow.  Doesn't sound related though. &lt;/p&gt;

The reason why I don't put curly braces in those cases, is because they are not needed. When I write $kernel that's enough, but when I want to use the cpu function for example, I use curly braces ${cpu cpu1} . The script works without any problem either way.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:41:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1117/conky-status-piped-to-i3bar-using-json-causes-text-to-flicker/?comment=1160#comment-1160</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Quelltextfabrik for &lt;p&gt;Once a couple of seconds (unrelated to update_interval from conky) the status is flickering in a very annoying way.

for me, this thread on bbs.archlinux.org viewtopic.php?pid=1279931#p1279931 (can't post links, sorry) held the answer.

Essentially, because of the way i3status parses JSON you need to make your JSON array one "physical" line.

So your 99+ lines of this:

    { "full_text" : "foo" },
    { "full_text" : "bar" },
    { "full_text" : "one more for good measure" }

simply becomes this:

    { "full_text" : "foo" },\
    { "full_text" : "bar" },\
    { "full_text" : "one more for good measure" }\

Hope that helps someone!</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 21:23:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1117/conky-status-piped-to-i3bar-using-json-causes-text-to-flicker/?answer=2126#post-id-2126</guid></item><item><title>Answer by phairland for &lt;p&gt;Once a couple of seconds (unrelated to update_interval from conky) the status is flickering in a very annoying way.

Change this:

    { "full_text" : "foo" },
    { "full_text" : "bar" },
    { "full_text" : "one more for good measure" }

To this:

    { "full_text" : "foo" },
    { "full_text" : "bar" },
    { "full_text" : "one more for good measure" },
