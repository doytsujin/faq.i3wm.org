hey guys,

I have following situation I don't understand. I've tried to visualize it. 
If I have 2 tabs. "tab2" is splith layout and has 2 terminals. If I close 
the window "terminal_2" (doesn't matter how: either exit, control+d, or 
kill the window) the focus jumps to "tab1". Usually if I close "terminal_2" 
I want to continue working in "terminal_1" and not first loose the focus to "tab1".

Do I missunderstand the idea behind that or 
is this behaviour at least configurable?

If I then create "another container" and split it in various terms and then close one of these terms I loose the focus to one of the tabs. It does not happen always but it feels to me a little unpredictible. Maybe everything works like it was thought to do.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 16:16:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/630/strange-focus-behaviour/?comment=657#comment-657</guid></item></channel></rss>
