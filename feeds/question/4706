How to configure i3bar for the behaviour?
In my i3 window covers i3bar. So I opened the thread :)</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 22:38:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4706/maximize-window-not-fullscreen-is-it-possible/?answer=4711#post-id-4711</guid></item><item><title>Comment by peterN for &lt;blockquote&gt;

It would be nice to quickly enlarge a single container to the full viewport with keeping i3bar in the bottom. Going fullscreen makes i3bar disappear, which is probably not the users/my intention.
That's how I understand the problem.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:42:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4706/maximize-window-not-fullscreen-is-it-possible/?comment=5843#comment-5843</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Man from Mars for &lt;p&gt;I want a key 'maximize window', not fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4706/maximize-window-not-fullscreen-is-it-possible/?answer=4707#post-id-4707</link><description>*A fullscreen window will not cover i3bar.* On the other side, if you mean "maximize width/height" there's no such thing in i3 (differently from stacking WMs) since the desktop space is always completely filled.
**Edit**: A little misunderstanding here (my initial statement about fullscreen windows): maximize means (to me) use all available screen space - this doesn't include the space taken by i3bar, if present and it's the default behaviour of i3/any tiling wm (fill the screen, as stated above, with i3 bar visible). "Fullscreen" takes *also* i3bar space.
If you want to spare a few more pixels you can remove window titles/borders for specific applications.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 20:16:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4706/maximize-window-not-fullscreen-is-it-possible/?answer=4707#post-id-4707</guid></item></channel></rss>
