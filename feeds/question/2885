I would like to get rid of the title-bars completely. I work mostly by workspaces and I don't want to see any title, don't wanna hear, don't wanna read.

I know of border none assignation and read about bb command but the first is useless in my case and I'm yet to figure out how to use bb command in config if that is even possible in this case.

Maybe with a script?

Thanks</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 07:30:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2885/disable-titlebar-completely/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2885/disable-titlebar-completely/?answer=2889#post-id-2889</link><description>Add this to your configuration (replace any existing `new_window` if necessary):

    new_window 1pixel

See [here](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_border_style_for_new_windows) for more information.

This will set borders on new windows to 1pixel if they are in a split container. In stacked or tabbed containers the title bar(s) will still be shown if there is more than one window in the container. </description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 10:11:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2885/disable-titlebar-completely/?answer=2889#post-id-2889</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Add this to your configuration (replace any existing &lt;code&gt;new_window&lt;/code&gt; if necessary):&lt;/p&gt;

And it works just like calling `border 1pixel` on every new window would, it removes the title bar. At least on windows in split containers. It seems that tabbed and stacked containers keep their title bar(s) no matter what you set.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 19:48:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2885/disable-titlebar-completely/?comment=2896#comment-2896</guid></item><item><title>Comment by gulver for &lt;p&gt;Add this to your configuration (replace any existing &lt;code&gt;new_window&lt;/code&gt; if necessary):&lt;/p&gt;

which renders a ~5px titlebar with no text. For me, that is better than having the titlebar completely disabled because you get an indication of the active window.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2013 14:42:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2885/disable-titlebar-completely/?answer=2911#post-id-2911</guid></item><item><title>Comment by YetAnotherAccount for &lt;p&gt;It's a little hacky, but you can get this by setting your font size to zero&lt;/p&gt;
