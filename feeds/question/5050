</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5050/match-gnome-window-style/?comment=5081#comment-5081</link><description>You asked for a hint or a keyword. I gave you both. I don't know what you mean by "insert." If you want qtCurve then run qtconfig and pick it from the menu. If qtCurve is not installed, then install it. You know what it's called, so figuring out how to install and use it is the next logical step.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 14:05:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5050/match-gnome-window-style/?comment=5081#comment-5081</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kaligule for &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;qtconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5050/match-gnome-window-style/?comment=5083#comment-5083</link><description>I didn't get qtconfig is a programm. I thought it was a file like ~/.config/qtconfig or ~/.qtconfig (thats why I wanted to know what to 'insert' into that file). Thank you.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 14:17:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5050/match-gnome-window-style/?comment=5083#comment-5083</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kaligule for &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;qtconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
