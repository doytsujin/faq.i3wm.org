It shows Bat when it's not charging and has a time remaining.  The percent though shows inf% and does not change.  I tried to add the integer line from the faq, but everywhere I put it when I restart i3 there is no bar at the bottom.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 01:10:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2408/i3bar-battery-percent/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by brocktice for &lt;p&gt;So I followed the two steps from a question on here sorry I can't post links&lt;/p&gt;

Deep in the i3status man page (and/or code, which is how I find it), you can find the option:

    last_full_capacity = true

which will use your battery's last full capacity, rather than the design capacity, to show the percentage. Fixed it for me on some cheap-o ASUS laptops.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 20:11:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2408/i3bar-battery-percent/?answer=3401#post-id-3401</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;So I followed the two steps from a question on here sorry I can't post links&lt;/p&gt;

An entirely missing bar suggests that you are reading the documentation and using options that are not supported in the version you are using (try upgrading).

If the battery indicator shows inf%, that is an issue with your charging electronics or kernel driver.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 06:14:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2408/i3bar-battery-percent/?answer=2409#post-id-2409</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kratisto for &lt;p&gt;You can run i3status in a terminal to see the error messages, if any.
