Ubuntu  also require changes to the network settings if you use a proxy, but this only involves a simple change in the Network Settings panel. This doesn't work in Linux Mint, the settings can be entered but will not remain saved.

 - Use a terminal to open `/etc/environment` using a text editor as superuser. E.g. `sudo gedit /etc/environment`.
 - Add the following lines to the text document that appears, replacing myproxy.server.com with your proxy address.

    

&gt; 
  
    http_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/ 
    https_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
    ftp_proxy=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
    no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com"
    HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/ 
    HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
    FTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.server.com:8080/
    NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com"

-  Save the file, then  navigate to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/` and create a new file there named 95proxies and include the following code (remembering to add your own proxy address in place of myproxy.server.com)

&gt; 
  
    Acquire::http::proxy "http://myproxy.server.com:8080/";
    Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp://myproxy.server.com:8080/";
    Acquire::https::proxy "https://myproxy.server.com:8080/";

Reboot and once you have logged in you will find that your proxy settings are in place for Network Settings, apt-get and Update manager. It's a pain but it does give you an idea about using the command line in a Linux terminal.
