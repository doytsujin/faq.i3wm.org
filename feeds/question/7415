    setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps

BTW, some application will overwrite the xkb configuration (eg, fcitx). So, you may need to check the wiki pages of your apps if it doesn't work.</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 13:01:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7415/switch-keyboard-layout-with-caps-lock/?answer=7561#post-id-7561</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;I would love to be able to switch keyboard layout with Caps Lock, how can I do it?&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7415/switch-keyboard-layout-with-caps-lock/?answer=7420#post-id-7420</link><description>As I understand you would like to disable Caps_Lock entirely.  
To do so, I have the following lines added to my `.Xmodmap` file.  
 
    clear Lock
    keycode 66 = Escape

`clear Lock`disables the Caps_Lock key  
`keycode 66 = Escape` maps Caps_Lock to Escape. For me it did not work with mapping by name, so had to map it's keycode directly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 08:47:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7415/switch-keyboard-layout-with-caps-lock/?answer=7420#post-id-7420</guid></item></channel></rss>
