Do you have any suggestion on how to implement it? It’s non-trivial unfortunately, at least with i3 v4.5.1. Possibly, the future layout saving can be used for this. I suggest to re-visit this feature request in a year or so.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2013 17:31:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1722/start-application-in-window-where-command-issued/?answer=1727#post-id-1727</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I would like to open a new terminal, type a command and expect the application to be run within the same window.

Works with bash and zsh. In stead of forking a new process from the shell, the current shell is replaced by the new process. See `man bash | less +'/^ +exec '`. 

As a side effect, the X-window gets killed, and i3 happens to do The Right Thing automatically: the new window takes place of the old one. </description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 04:56:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1722/start-application-in-window-where-command-issued/?answer=1729#post-id-1729</guid></item></channel></rss>
