 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2143/how-to-launch-rdesktop/?answer=2166#post-id-2166</link><description>I personally created a bash file (named jHome) and put the following contents in it:

    #!/bin/bash
    rdesktop -g 95% ipaddress:port

The -g option makes it so it automatically fills 95% of the screen (which is about perfect for i3). 

Then made it executable and put it in my PATH. Then I just hit meta+d, type 'jH' and enter and away it goes. I understand that's not fullscreen, but it takes up most of the screen and allows me to switch between desktops in i3 as well.

I have not had any real issues opening/operating rdesktop, </description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 21:13:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2143/how-to-launch-rdesktop/?answer=2166#post-id-2166</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;when i try to launch rdesktop with the dmenu, nothing happens.  when i launch it from a terminal, it seems to ignore all the keys, like fullscreen, and float toggle.  how do i get rdesktop to launch fullscreen?&lt;/p&gt;
