With `focus output left/right` I can achieve the former behaviour but when I change the workspace in my focused monitor, that workspace will be called into the monitor where it was first opened.

I can work around this with `move workspace to output right` if that workspace appeared on my left monitor, but it quickly become troublesome:

1. Wherever my focus is, call the workspace I want to move with `Mod+Number`
2. Observe where it appeared, then **Think and Understand** where it is, and where I want it to be next.
3. Move it. **Done**

That 2nd step is what I want to avoid since confuses me and breaks my workflow. There's a way to this?

 1. Select the monitor where I want the workspace.
