I dislike this behaviour and which to change it so that the fn modifier isn't needed to access F1-F12
Let's take the toggle-wifi/F12 key as an example.
In xev, I see that the toggle-wifi keycode is 255, and the F12's is 96. Now, if I change with xmodmap what the keycode 255 should do, such as with `xmodmap -e "keycode 255 = l", now every time I press that key it types an 'l', BUT IT STILL toggles the wifi.
I am not sure what part of the system is responsible for these mappings, and if it is specific to i3, to X, or a lower level thing.

I would appreciate some help or pointers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 01:11:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5394/remapping-function-keys/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;My laptop requires one to press the fn modifier to access the function keys F1-F12,  while the standard keypressess access the multimedia keys, brightness, toggle-wifi, etc.

Some laptops (e.g. Lenovo E325) allow switching the behaviour of the function keys in the BIOS, so that you get the special functions with Fn+F12 and plain F12 without.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 09:32:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5394/remapping-function-keys/?comment=5397#comment-5397</guid></item></channel></rss>
