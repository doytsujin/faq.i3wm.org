First off, welcome to i3!
Do you want a pure i3 environment in Ubuntu, or do you want your existing desktop environment (Unity, I guess) to cooperate with i3?

If you want to use i3 on its own, you should be able to choose the i3 session on the login screen. By clicking the Ubuntu symbol near the text field, where the username ad password goes.

If you want to use your current desktop environment in combination with i3, someone else might be more of a help, as I have no experience with that. But I read that it's possible. 

Also, if you're new, you might be interested in this  [short video introduction.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf)
This is not my work, I've just picked it up somewhere and believe it's a nice way to start off.
The first video also explains how to log in to an i3 session, with a fresh Ubuntu.

By default Unity uses the `metacity` window manager, I assume you can somehow integrate i3 with unity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 00:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7344/i3-on-ubuntu-1504-does-not-start/?comment=7377#comment-7377</guid></item><item><title>Comment by skypickle for &lt;p&gt;Hi!

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7344/i3-on-ubuntu-1504-does-not-start/?comment=7375#comment-7375</link><description>thank you for answering. I would like to be able to manage various  windows with i3 when logged into vanilla UBUNTU. Although Ubuntu does offer ctrl-alt with the keypad to move windows around, it will not automatically tile them. I would like to be able to tile ALL windows.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 23:46:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7344/i3-on-ubuntu-1504-does-not-start/?comment=7375#comment-7375</guid></item><item><title>Comment by apoc for &lt;p&gt;Hi!
