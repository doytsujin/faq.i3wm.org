That is, your fingers should be in that position anyway, so you don’t need to move them when switching windows.

Note that hjkl was most likely chosen just for historic reasons, not for ergonomic reasons:

Therefore, i3’s choice is more ergonomic, IMO.

In all those layouts "hjkl" works (those keys are in the same locations as on US-qwerty) Meanwhile, most people who are likely to use i3 are likely to be used to vim keybindings anyway.
