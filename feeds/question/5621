Firstly, I want to say I love i3. I enjoy it's lightness, it's speed it's easy configurability that makes my work fast and efficient.

The one thing that keeps me looking elsewhere is the lack of the ability to create workspaces as a grid. A simple 3x3 grid gives me a clean visual map of where everything is... (ie 9 workspaces in a 3 x 3 grid) Not unlike being able to tile windows in a visually appealing and effective way.

Is there any way this is (or could be made) possible in i3?

*i3* creates workspaces dynamically when you switch to them or a window is created on them. They are also removed dynamically when there are no windows on them and they are not visible. Usually *i3* will start up with only as many workspaces as you have displays, unless you assign and automatically start programs on other workspaces. 

Other than on the *i3bar* workspaces in *i3* do not really have a positional relation to each other. The only time a floating window that is pushed outside of the screenspace will apear on another workspace is if you have multiple displays and you move it from one display to the other. Otherwise if you move a window to the right out of a workpace it will not appear on another workpace that is right of your current one on the *i3bar*.

So at least internally, there is no way to get *i3* to order workspaces in a 3x3 grid. (Other than actually hooking up 9 displays set up in a 3x3 grid)

----

That being said, *i3* does not prevent you from thinking of the workspaces being ordered in a 3x3 grid. You could for example use the numpad keys for key bindings related to workspaces instead of the number row:

    bindsym $mod+KP_1 workspace 1: SW
    bindsym $mod+KP_2 workspace 2: S
    bindsym $mod+KP_3 workspace 3: SE
    bindsym $mod+KP_4 workspace 4: W
    bindsym $mod+KP_5 workspace 5: M
    bindsym $mod+KP_6 workspace 6: E
    bindsym $mod+KP_7 workspace 7: NW
    bindsym $mod+KP_8 workspace 8: N
    bindsym $mod+KP_9 workspace 9: NE
    bindsym $mod+Shift+KP_1 move workspace 1: SW
    # [...] and so on

You could even use the [*i3* IPC interface](http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html) to set up some scripts that allow to move to another workspace by giving a direction. For example `workspace_right` would go from `7: NW` to `8: N` or `5: M` to `6: E`.

Back then it was not possible to switch WS, but maybe it works now, or some other pager works better.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2015 07:25:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5621/workspaces-as-grid/?comment=5677#comment-5677</guid></item></channel></rss>
