For example `Alt`+`Backspace` should be deleting the word, and `Alt`+`#` should be commenting the line, but because i3wm (default config) takes usage of `Alt` (`Mod1`) command as prefix for most of the commands how do you go around this? Do people solve this by using a combination of `Ctrl`+`Alt` as a basic replacement for `Mod1`?

I am sure there's a simple solution to this problem I couldn't find :( </description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 16:34:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6490/conflict-safe-bash-and-i3wm-interoperability-of-alt-command/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;How to make it possible inside i3wm for &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; command to continue working as it should when in bash terminal? &lt;/p&gt;

So Alt+Backspace should only be grabbed by i3 if there is actually a binding defined for it. Put that binding on something else and it should be available for your terminal again.

However, I'd personally recommend using the Windows key as the modifier for i3. So many applications have shortcuts which typically work on Alt, you'll only run into more problems. Plus it sort of makes sense to have the "windows" key control your window manager. ;)</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 21:26:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6490/conflict-safe-bash-and-i3wm-interoperability-of-alt-command/?answer=6491#post-id-6491</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;i3 will only grab the exact bindings that are configured.

Meaning, Alt is actually on every keyboard but the Windows Keys might not be. It is easier to change the modifier key, if you can open any programs (for which you already need the modifier in i3)</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 20:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6490/conflict-safe-bash-and-i3wm-interoperability-of-alt-command/?comment=6495#comment-6495</guid></item><item><title>Comment by milanaleksic for &lt;p&gt;i3 will only grab the exact bindings that are configured.
