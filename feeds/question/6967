 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6967/switch-all-windows-from-two-workspaces/?answer=6970#post-id-6970</link><description>You can use the `rename workspace` command (see [its description in the i3 User's Guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_renaming_workspaces)). Say, you want to swap workspaces 1 and 2. If "temporary" is an unused workspace name, you can issue the following command from the command line:

    i3-msg "rename workspace 1 to temporary; rename workspace 2 to 1; rename workspace temporary to 2"

You can of course write a script for this or even create a key binding if you do this often.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 15:07:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6967/switch-all-windows-from-two-workspaces/?answer=6970#post-id-6970</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I want to switch all windows from the current workspace with the windows on a given workspace.
