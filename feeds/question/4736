I'm using i3 in a Virtualbox Linux guest on a Windows host.

Now the monitors are working almost perfectly. They're all displaying in their correct resolutions and the ordering is correct when I move my mouse across them, ie. if I move the mouse from the left-most monitor to the right-most monitor, everything behaves as expected.

The problem is that i3's version of the ordering of the monitors doesn't match the physical ordering, or the ordering that the mouse sees.

Instead of the monitors being left to right "1 2 3", they're "3 1 2" or "3 2 1". The `focus right` and `focus left` commands reflect the wrong ordering and so I can't use the keyboard shortcuts to horizontally switch between windows in a logical manner.

Any ideas how I can fix this?

**EDIT**

Here is my `xrandr` output. I had assumed it was an i3 issue (or at least fixable via i3) mainly because the behaviour is correct and keyboard shortcuts contradict what I see when I move the mouse, but I could easily be wrong about that.
