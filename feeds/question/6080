Could you please add the relevant parts of your configuration? And do the affected applications actually run twice (e.g. are two terminals being opened) or do you just see it in the output of `ps` or similar tools? In which case that output would help, too.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2015 13:01:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6080/exec-spawns-2-processes/?comment=6089#comment-6089</guid></item></channel></rss>
