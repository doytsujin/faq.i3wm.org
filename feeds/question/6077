I would like to ask you a simple thing: how to hold a window always above the others?

I use i3 and want to have a good graphical statusbar, not a text-based one (I often use performance-heavy software, and I need to monitor my cpu to avoid to burn my laptop); I want it to be able to show a graph, and to execute an action on click, while also stay on every monitor I use and show me all the workspaces present on that monitor. The latter can be accomplished only with i3 statusbars (i3status, etc.) while the former, - by conky. So I decided to show the conky bar as a floating window above the i3status, so it can do what I want. The problem here is: How do I set conky to be floating, and always on top of others? Can it be accomplished with something like this:

----------
for_window [class="Conky"] floating enable ?

----------
Thank you in advance for your help.

Floating windows will always stay on top of tiled windows, but other than that there's no such mechanism in i3. However, there is an [open issue #1455](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/1455) to implement a sticky property for floating windows. I'm not sure whether this includes staying on top of all other floating windows.

Either way, the real problem here is that you abuse floating mode. Anything panel-y should be a dock. That being said, floating windows in i3 will be on top of docked windows. </description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 06:02:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6077/window-always-on-top/?answer=6096#post-id-6096</guid></item></channel></rss>
