If I use the mouse to go from one screen to a other screen (move it from the left screen to the right screen), the cursor sometimes jumps back in the middle of the previous screen. This only happens if there are windows on both screens. If there is no open window on both screens, the mouse works as expected. I think this is related to the default behaviour of the cursor jump if I switch the screens with the keyboard?</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2012 17:35:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/352/cursor-jumps-to-window/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Miro for &lt;p&gt;When I change the window with the keyboard shortcut to a window on another screen (i use a dual head display), the cursor jumps in the middle of the window I just go to.
