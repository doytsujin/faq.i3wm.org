The current implementation (startup notifications and manual assignments) covers all the cases better than what the thought-experiment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2013 21:27:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2949/making-popup-window-appear-on-their-parents-workspace/?comment=2979#comment-2979</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I launch a long process in an application that once finished will popup a window.&lt;/p&gt;

A simple workaround would be to use `assign` to force certain applications to open all their windows on the same workspace:

    assign [class="AppWithPopups1"] SomeWorkspace
    assign [class="AppWithPopups2"] SomeOtherWorkspace

Also, in more recent versions of *i3* a workspace will be marked as urgent if a window is opened on it while the workspace is not visible. This way you will also know immediately when and which application opened a new window.
