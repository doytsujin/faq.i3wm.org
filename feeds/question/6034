See for example [#1699](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/1699). Our current standing on this, in particular for games, is that games should confine the cursor to their own window theirselves and if they don't, you should file a bug against them.

Unfortunately this cannot be done in an external tool either. Trust me â€“ I tried. For an explanation see the ticket above.

What you *could* do is temporarily change your external screen setup and moving them to a layout like this:

    +---+
    |   |
    +---+---+
        |   |
        +---+</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 11:50:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6034/how-to-play-gui-games-in-a-multi-monitor-configuration/?answer=6037#post-id-6037</guid></item></channel></rss>
