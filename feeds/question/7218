This is nice, because the top row shows workspace buttons for my external monitor, and the bottom row shows workspace buttons for my laptop screen.

But sometimes (including right now) I only get one row, corresponding to the workspace buttons for my laptop screen alone.

How can I ensure that both rows are present, since I like this behavior? (And conversely, how can I switch back to "only the row corresponding to this monitor"?)

Thanks!

Any i3bar is only ever supposed to display the workspaces of the output it is on, not that of others. Make sure you are running the latest version of i3 and file a bug report for this (see the debugging docs on the website on how to report a bug).

That said, the feature you are looking for won't be implemented (I feel rather confident saying this, even if I'm not the one deciding it). But using tools like xdotool, and a recent i3 version, it'd be possible to move the i3bar from one screen to another screen. That's not supported behavior, however. </description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2015 08:39:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7218/how-to-ensure-two-rows-of-workspace-buttons-on-my-laptop-screen/?answer=7222#post-id-7222</guid></item></channel></rss>
