 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/528/binding-mouse-buttons/?answer=2351#post-id-2351</link><description>Some workaround I use. I have mouse with additional buttons, so I've found out with `xev` the button code (6). And changed ~/.xbindkeysrc to:

    "xdotool key alt+F4"
    b:6

(alt+F4 is my combination to close window)

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/528/binding-mouse-buttons/?answer=2397#post-id-2397</link><description>You could also consider a program such as easy stroke. You can map various mouse gestures including combinations of buttons with or without pauses to any key combination. I've used it for years with openbox to essentially move windows into various tiling manager type arrangements. Experimenting now with it in combination with i3. </description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 14:06:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/528/binding-mouse-buttons/?answer=2397#post-id-2397</guid></item></channel></rss>
