My second monitor works in Gnome/Unity without problems but it is blurry and shaky in i3. Evidently, i3 ignores the settings I've made when I was logged in to the Gnome session.

Like above I've changed my keyboard delay/speed in Gnome but again, i3 ignores that setting.

Yet, I have made my wireless configuration in Gnome but this time i3 seems to know about that and works fine.

So I'd like to ask..

1. Where exactly does i3 get in the play? How close does it play with Gnome?
2. Are there any good documents explaining this mess of X/Window Managers/Gnome/Unity so one could at least know where to blame/curse/fix when something goes wrong. 
3. More specifically, how will I make i3 respect the display configuration I've made in Gnome so I'll have a working setup with i3.


ps. this is all happening on Ubuntu 12.10.

In general, i3 is a window manager. It does not care about anything else (e.g. wireless settings), thatâ€™s what desktop environments are for.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2012 10:58:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/767/general-misunderstanding-of-gnome-i3-window-managers-in-general/?answer=769#post-id-769</guid></item><item><title>Answer by utku for &lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

    exec gnome-settings-daemon

I wish this came as a default or documented better or came commented out in the default i3 config.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2012 09:41:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/767/general-misunderstanding-of-gnome-i3-window-managers-in-general/?answer=768#post-id-768</guid></item></channel></rss>
