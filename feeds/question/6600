Any thoughts? Am I just ignorant?

You need to find out what that package is called in your system and install it. You might have to repeat this process for other header files.

Since CentOS seems to be based on Fedora, it may be these:

    libxcb-devel xcb-util-keysyms-devel xcb-util-devel xcb-util-wm-devel yajl-devel libXrandr-devel startup-notification-devel libev-devel xcb-util-cursor-devel libXinerama-devel libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel pcre-devel pango-devel git gcc
