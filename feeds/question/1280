I tried different things in /etc/i3/config:
Changing `bindsym Mod1+semicolon` to `bindsym Mod1+ö` did not work as well as changing it to `bind Mod1+47` (found out keycode 47 via xev as described in the userguide.

Can anybody tell me how it´s possible to use the umlaut ö for focusing tiles.

Thank you in advance for your efforts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2013 13:13:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1280/focus-qwertz-with-jklo-similar-to-jkl-on-querty/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;I just installed i3 and i´m quite excited.

If this typo is also in your config, this should solve the issue. I'm using exactly that, namely 'bindcode $mod+47' to move focus right and here it is working!</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 11:24:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1280/focus-qwertz-with-jklo-similar-to-jkl-on-querty/?comment=1376#comment-1376</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I just installed i3 and i´m quite excited.

    bindsym Mod1+odiaeresis

You can use `xev(1)` to find out the X11 names for keys.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2013 10:13:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1280/focus-qwertz-with-jklo-similar-to-jkl-on-querty/?answer=1386#post-id-1386</guid></item><item><title>Answer by IcantReed for &lt;p&gt;I just installed i3 and i´m quite excited.

Two things, that i did wrong:

 1. I always was editing /etc/i3/config instead of /home/myuser/.i3/config :-/
 2. You have to change `bindsym Mod1+semicolon` to `bindcode $mod+47 focus right`

So now I´m able to focus the windows with Modifier + jklö.
