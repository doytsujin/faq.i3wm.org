If you are experiencing different behavior, please explain in detail what's happening.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 20:17:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1584/limit-mouse-in-just-one-monitor/?comment=1585#comment-1585</guid></item><item><title>Comment by raoof for &lt;p&gt;hi and thank u for your great job on i3 &lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1584/limit-mouse-in-just-one-monitor/?answer=1588#post-id-1588</link><description>As a start you can add &lt;code&gt;focus\_follows_mouse no&lt;/code&gt; to your config file. However, this will not restrict the mouse to the current workspace, but only make the focus stay right where it is regardless the mouse pointer position.

**Update:**
The closest to the behaviour you want that I know of is the following: Adjust the vertical position of your favorite monitor relative to the second one using &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt;. Let us assume your primal monitor is on output HDMI1 and the secondary has a vertical resolution of e.g. 1080px. Then you can try the following command:
&lt;pre&gt;
xrandr --output HDMI1 --pos 0x1080
&lt;/pre&gt;
This moves the HDMI1 monitor below the secondary one, so that the mouse cursor is practically banned to the primal monitor except for the upper right edge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2013 08:22:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1584/limit-mouse-in-just-one-monitor/?answer=1588#post-id-1588</guid></item><item><title>Comment by raoof for &lt;p&gt;As a start you can add &lt;code&gt;focus_follows_mouse no&lt;/code&gt; to your config file.
