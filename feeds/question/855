i have installed I3 for the very first time. 
Now i can open Browsers etc. And i can also open a Terminal with alt+enter
But!!: If i open a terminal, there is just a black background in the terminal and i cant write anything in it...
is there any solution ? Because without having a working terminal, I3 is very useless for me.
Thank you very very much.
