 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4856/force-quit-non-responsive-application/?answer=5373#post-id-5373</link><description>Try using a console and get the offending application's process ID and kill it that way and see if the window closes and i3 adjusts accordingly then. Alternatively, if another desktop manager is installed somewhere on the system like Gnome or KDE a process manager might simplify the task for those unfamiliar with and/or not attracted to the CLI way.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 14:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4856/force-quit-non-responsive-application/?answer=5373#post-id-5373</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to take an application, that has stopped working (steam on wine for ex) and force quit it through i3?

Binding it to a Shortcut did not work here, but maybe you can get it to work somehow.

It seems like there has to be another X-application between *i3* and `xkill`.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2015 13:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4856/force-quit-non-responsive-application/?comment=5387#comment-5387</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;Have you tried &lt;code&gt;xkill&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;br/&gt;
