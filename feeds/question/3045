I just came across the *autoswap_mac* plugin for Vim by Damian Conway and was wondering if someone had already ported it to i3?

Short summary of what that plugin does (at least part of):

if you try to edit a file with Vim and it is already open in another Vim session in another terminal, it exits Vim and sets focus to the terminal containing the other Vim session.

If you search for *OSCON 2013: "More Instantly Better Vim" - Damian Conway* on YouTube you will get a better explanation by the author (from minute 12 on).
