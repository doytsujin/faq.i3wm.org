This will happen when I am doing running some semi intensive application, for example streaming a video on youtube or running a web server locally. 
The strange thing is this never happened whilst using ubuntu (stock standard) - and I certainly ran the laptop harder on ubuntu.
Just wondering if this has come up before or if anyone has a similar problem?</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 08:36:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4655/laptop-overheats-regularly-whilst-using-i3/</guid></item></channel></rss>
