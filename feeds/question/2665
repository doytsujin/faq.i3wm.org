Use **xwininfo** (and click on the offending window) or use **-all** and find it

Then use **xkill -id** [*window id from xwininfo*]

That will do away with even the most persistent pests.... </description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 22:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2665/how-to-deal-with-the-window-that-can-not-be-closed-by-modshiftq/?answer=6111#post-id-6111</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I found there is a small window floating at the corner of the screen. this window is not working properly as it always displays part of contents in other windows.
