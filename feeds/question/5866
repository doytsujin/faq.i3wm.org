e.g.   

    urxvt -name floating 

and then add a rule to your i3config.

    for_window [class="URxvt" instance"floating"] floating enable

In your i3 config file it would look something like this:

    bindsym $sup+3 exec urxvt
    bindsym $sup+4 exec urxvt -name floating
    for_window [class="URxvt" instance="floating"] floating enable border pixel 3

This works with xterm, urxvt and might also work for other programs where you can set a name or the window title.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 10:11:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5866/two-keybindings-for-starting-terminal-normally-and-floating/?answer=5867#post-id-5867</guid></item></channel></rss>
