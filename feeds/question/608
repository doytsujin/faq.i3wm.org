i have 2 desktops installed, xfce for comfort &amp; i3 because it's great :)

in xfce i can easily configure keyboard but need help with i3.

in xfce the ' @ ' sign is correctly over the number 2, and the ' " ' sign is just above the rhs shift key.

when i log into i3, these 2 are reversed. i am sure there is an easy answer, but i am blind to it.

any help appreciated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2012 00:23:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/608/i3-mac-keyboard/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by flipper T for &lt;p&gt;i have 2 desktops installed, xfce for comfort &amp;amp; i3 because it's great :)&lt;/p&gt;

It might also work to start some Xfce-specific settings program to load the Xfce settings, but I donâ€™t know which one it is.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2012 07:36:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/608/i3-mac-keyboard/?answer=609#post-id-609</guid></item></channel></rss>
