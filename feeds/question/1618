In your case you should create a script like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
i3status | while :
do
    read line
    user=`whoami`
    echo "whoami: $user | $line" || exit 1
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
Make the script executable and run it instead of i3status in your i3 config file.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 17:20:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1618/add-user-name-to-status-bar/?answer=1620#post-id-1620</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Maestraccio for &lt;p&gt;As in my answer here: &lt;a href="https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1537/show-title-of-focused-window-in-status-bar/"&gt;https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1537/sh...&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, not enough karma for links) you could try an external script.

I guess that the colors issue is due to the fact that the line is wrapped in a script.

But now it appears at the left of the status bar, where it is covered by the workspace tabs, and the colors are gone!
For now I am happy with the result, but I will certainly try to find out how I can get it on the other side and recover the colors.

As @joepd and @mschaefer suggested, you can do it easily using py3status while keeping the colors and having the possibility to order your modules' output on your i3bar. 

I've created a module named whoami.py in the examples directory of py3status sources which does the work :)

I hope this helps !</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 11:41:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1618/add-user-name-to-status-bar/?answer=3039#post-id-3039</guid></item></channel></rss>
