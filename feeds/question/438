I was able to enable floating on just the cssh windows, but the downside to that is I have to move them myself after they are created. (the all get spawned on top of each other)

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/438/cssh-window-placement/?comment=439#comment-439</link><description>I'm having the same problem.  Just to clarify: cssh usually controls window placement itself.  I *think* it worked with some earlier (4.x) version of i3; i.e., the windows weren't spawned on top of each other when floating was enabled for cssh windows.  I guess we should provide some debug output.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2012 16:07:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/438/cssh-window-placement/?comment=439#comment-439</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oberon for &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with cssh, it allows multiple ssh sessions to be controlled via a single input and is very useful if you are doing the same task on multiple servers.&lt;/p&gt;

    bindsym $mod+s layout stacking
    bindsym $mod+w layout tabbed
    bindsym $mod+e layout toggle split

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/438/cssh-window-placement/?answer=6137#post-id-6137</link><description>It does work for me, with this i3 config :

    for_window [title="CSSH"] floating enable

Maybe you can just select the "retile windows" menu entry of cssh, after launch ? (alt-r shortcut).

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/438/cssh-window-placement/?answer=447#post-id-447</link><description>Spawning windows in a grid automatically is not possible currently, unless you write an external script for it (which is possible, but I haven’t done it and I don’t know of any such script).

As for floating windows not opening in the right spot: You can check the i3 logfile (see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html) for the geometry which a floating window requests.

One likely cause for floating windows not opening in the right spot is that the application might save the previous window position/size and try to restore it.

You mentioned that it worked with a previous version of i3. Reverting to that version and narrowing it down would be helpful. If you figure out it’s between (say) 4.1 and current git "next", you could use `git bisect` to figure out the exact commit which introduced the problem. In any case, once you’re sure this is a regression, please file a ticket at http://bugs.i3wm.org/</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 23:15:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/438/cssh-window-placement/?answer=447#post-id-447</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TheQueasle for &lt;p&gt;Spawning windows in a grid automatically is not possible currently, unless you write an external script for it (which is possible, but I haven’t done it and I don’t know of any such script).&lt;/p&gt;

As far as 'it worked with a previous version of i3' goes, that was from Holger's comments to the original post.  I just started using i3 at 4.2
