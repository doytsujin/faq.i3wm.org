    assign [class="Conky" title="whatever"] workspace 1

I highly recommend to use variable names for your workspaces to reduce typos.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4981/assign-conky-to-screen/?answer=5124#post-id-5124</link><description>Since you stated in a comment that you’re specifying `own_window_type override` in your conkyrc, you’ll need to fix this within conky, or with a third-party tool that influences the conky window, perhaps `xdotool`.

The reason is that the override hint entirely bypasses the window manager, i3 literally must not (and will not) manage that window :).</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 22:40:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4981/assign-conky-to-screen/?answer=5124#post-id-5124</guid></item></channel></rss>
