 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/75/how-do-i-change-the-orientation-of-an-existing-container/?answer=77#post-id-77</link><description>If you have a container with 2 windows A and B split vertically (B under A), and you want to change it to horizontally, just:

 - focus on A 
 - mod+h
 - move focus to B
 - mod+Shift+Arrow (move B "into" A)

this should do the trick.

Sometimes, when I want to move a window into different containers, I usually move them to floating mode, go to the new container (and set the mode h/v) and focus back on the floating window and move it to tiled again. Very cool the things you can do with these simple commands!</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 05:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/75/how-do-i-change-the-orientation-of-an-existing-container/?answer=77#post-id-77</guid></item><item><title>Answer by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;Using mod+h and mod+v splits the current container.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/75/how-do-i-change-the-orientation-of-an-existing-container/?answer=4137#post-id-4137</link><description>You can use the `layout` command with a `splitv` or `splith` argument (here, without a space before H or V!). You can bind a keystroke to these commands if you wish, in your i3's configuration file.

As an example, here is what stands in my configuration (I got ride of `$mod+e`):

    bindsym $mod+v layout splitv
    bindsym $mod+h layout splith
    bindsym $mod+s layout stacking
    bindsym $mod+w layout tabbed

    bindsym $mod+Shift+h split h
    bindsym $mod+Shift+v split v

With this, `$mod+h` and `$mod+v` acts for the tilling orientation like `$mod+w` and `$mod+s` act for the overlapping orientation (not toggling, directly specifying an orientation instead), and creation of a split container is as before, except it needs a shift modifier.
