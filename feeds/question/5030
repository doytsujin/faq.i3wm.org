I'd like to set a single key to make i3 perform several actions one by one. So, let's say I want Mod4+j to do this:

"Open gimp /this/file.xcf, pcmanfm and inkscape /this/file.svg in workspace 2."

This is what I was doing with Fluxbox until now I switched to i3. It then looked like this:
Mod4 Shift Alt j :MacroCmd {Workspace 3}{Exec soundgrain /bla/bla/circles.sg}{Exec din}{Exec slgui -L /bla/bla/mar.slsess}

However, what I was trying for ages was little more complicated. If I can get i3 to do it in one hit, I kiss your feet :)

"Open qjackctl and Catia in workspace 2; 
switch to workspace 3 and open wine /home/usr/.wine/reaper.exe; 
wait 20 seconds (to avoid Reaper opening in next workspace, since it takes a lot); 
switch to workspace 4 and open two files with their default programmes."

Thanks very much in advance.
Regards.

If so, just use `for_window` rules and you won't even have to worry about waiting 20 seconds.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 16:10:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5030/keybinding-to-open-more-than-one-program/?comment=5035#comment-5035</guid></item><item><title>Answer by smlb for &lt;p&gt;Hi.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5030/keybinding-to-open-more-than-one-program/?answer=5129#post-id-5129</link><description>You can simply bind it to a shortcut, example:

    bindsym $mod+b exec i3-msg 'workspace 2; exec gimp file.xcf; workspace 9; exec urxvt -e something; workspace 5; exec firefox; workspace 1'

Sidenote: the last `workspace 1` take you automatically to workspace 1. That's all. As Micheal said, there is the *Save Layouts* feature.</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 01:23:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5030/keybinding-to-open-more-than-one-program/?answer=5129#post-id-5129</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi.
