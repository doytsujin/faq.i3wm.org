When I visit my webmail (fastmail or outlook), if I try to write a new email, the focus will briefly be on the new window, then it goes back to the parent after a moment. Which results in my entering a few characters into the 'to:' or 'body' of the message, then having to manually switch focus back to the previous window, and then back to the message window.

I've had similar issues with Thunderbird. Setting the programs to tile, rather than float, makes things a little better, but the problem still pops up occasionally. Some times I get stuck with a Thunderbird message window that I cannot enter text in at all, as focus remains in the parent window.

I've tried switching the 'focus-follows-mouse' setting, but that doesn't seem to help. Any other suggestions?  </description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 14:42:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4954/losing-focus-on-child-windows-firefox-thunderbird/</guid></item></channel></rss>
