I'm using GNU/Octave a lot, and when I launch a script with several plots and switch workspace, the plot windows appear on the new workspace.

Ok, clarification :
On workspace 1, I launch a term with GNU/Octave. In Octave, I start a script. The script will do some computations (which can last several minutes) and plot figures in new containers (one per figure). I will switch workspace once the script is started (i don't like to wait), but I want the plot containers to appear on the same workspaces as GNU/Octave.

How can I make them appear on the old one ?

Thanks !

It might help checking the name/class of the window that opens into the workspace. Then create a rule in your i3 config that specifies that every time certain class of window opens will put it in a specific workspace.

Syntax:

    assign &lt;criteria&gt; [→] workspace

Examples:

    # Assign URxvt terminals to workspace 2
    assign [class="URxvt"] 2
    
    # Same thing, but more precise (exact match instead of substring)
    assign [class="^URxvt$"] 2
    
    # Same thing, but with a beautiful arrow :)
    assign [class="^URxvt$"] → 2
    
    # Assignment to a named workspace
    assign [class="^URxvt$"] → work
    
    # Start urxvt -name irssi
    assign [class="^URxvt$" instance="^irssi$"] → 3
