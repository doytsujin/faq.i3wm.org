There seem to be no guidelines published anywhere on i3wm.org
about what's the recommended mean of submitting a bug or a patch.

There seem to me more than one way to do that:

* submit to the i3 Trac
* post to the mailing list
* e-mail Michael directly
* speak on the IRC channel

Some users seemed to be confused and the questions
how to do it come back frequently.
