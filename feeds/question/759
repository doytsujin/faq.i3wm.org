I tried it with mod set to mod1 (alt) and mod4(meta/win key). Is there a debug mode I can use to check what i3wm is seeing on those key bindings? Or is there a common incompatibility with some machines/keyboards that I haven't found?</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 01:43:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/759/modshiftat-move-container-to-workspace-2-not-working/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I installed i3wm on two machines today.
