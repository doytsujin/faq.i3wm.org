I would like it the way all desktop environments (Gnome, ...) do it. They close the window properly. It does not only concern to unsaved documents. Also, i.e. Firefox does not close a clean way. After logout and login to i3, firefox tells "Sorry, Firefox crashed...". I think this means, i3 kills all applications the hard way. Why? This is not usefull. I can not close all open windows with Mod+Shift+Q before logout.

Is this not what you in fact do when using say Gnome Desktop etc - close the window by clicking the x button for each open window then logoff/shutdown. Mod+shift+E is killing X window server which effectively crashes open applications</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2014 16:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4371/logout-with-modshifte-discards-unsafed-documents-how-to-avoid-this/?comment=5177#comment-5177</guid></item><item><title>Comment by maikel for &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I do not accept your answer as a good answer to my question.

How many windows can you possibly have open? Many more than necessary, I'd wager.</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 20:47:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4371/logout-with-modshifte-discards-unsafed-documents-how-to-avoid-this/?comment=4383#comment-4383</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I do not accept your answer as a good answer to my question.

Computers are stupid, and while they can be made to do some wonderful things, time spent trying to make them do someting smart might be better spent learning good work habits.

Every time you make a change to a document, save it. Full stop. Even if (for whatever reason) you don't save every single time you make a change you shouldn't give yourself the opportunity to forget that you have unsaved work. [Avoid multitasking like the plague](http://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking). It's pointless. Finish what's important and then move on to the next task.</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 16:28:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4371/logout-with-modshifte-discards-unsafed-documents-how-to-avoid-this/?answer=4376#post-id-4376</guid></item></channel></rss>
