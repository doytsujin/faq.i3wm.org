 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1052/trackpad-horizontal-scrolling/?answer=3698#post-id-3698</link><description>If you still come over this issue:

 1. Find your Synaptics TouchPad ID

    xinput --list
 2. Get your current settings:

    xinput --watch-props &lt;ID&gt;

 3. Propably your "Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling" will have the value 1, 0

 4. Change it to 1, 1 with

    xinput --set-prop &lt;ID&gt; "Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling" 1 1

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1052/trackpad-horizontal-scrolling/?answer=1056#post-id-1056</link><description>I would upgrade to the current version of i3 (4.4). This will probably not solve your issue, but fixes some others, and will give you some new features. 

This sounds like a question specific to hardware/Xorg. I would search over there instead of the window manager. If it works in another window manager/DE, investigate how this is done. I suppose you'll be better off asking at your distro's help channels. </description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 19:18:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1052/trackpad-horizontal-scrolling/?answer=1056#post-id-1056</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Goran for &lt;p&gt;How do I enable this in i3(ubuntu 12.10, i3 4.2) ?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1052/trackpad-horizontal-scrolling/?answer=1059#post-id-1059</link><description>Joepad tnx for the info, I will definitely try 4.4 at some point. I would like to dive in to the code and add a phew things.

I managed to solve it. Driver controlling the track pad is called synaptics and settings is somewhere inside "xorg.conf". In my case  it's the
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf
In the file it says that the file is automatically generated and it might be rewritten after distribution update so it's better to move the content to : /etc/X11/xorg.conf (xorg.conf does not exist  any more on Ubuntu by default  "automatisaion")

Anyway I just edited the file didn't make xorg.conf 
Inside (Section "InputClass") I added
        option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "on"

To see the supported options and if it's working in console type "synclient"
If all is well you should see
    VertTwoFingerScroll     = 1
    HorizTwoFingerScroll    = 1
