the bar that appears at top of screen with mod + d, is very useful but also quite hard to see.

i have changed the font for window headers in the i3 config file, but this has no effect on that top search bar-thingy. :)

any way to change font size on that ?

thx.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2012 23:27:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/593/mod-1-d-config/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;new to i3, so sorry if obvious question.&lt;/p&gt;

Do a `less $(which dmenu_run)`, and check the manpage of dmenu. You'll be able to adjust the dmenu-script to your preferences. 

Of course, if you want to avoid your customized dmenu_run being overwritten by your distribution, copy it first to, say, `~/bin`, and point `$mod+letter` in `i3/config` to that location. 

If you want to get fancy, there are multiple patches/forks of dmenu. Think of listing the entries vertically, using more fonts with pango, or with history support. Search your available repositories, and you might find a gem.

I am using manjaro (a newish arch derivative) and can therefore use arch &amp; aur repositories. 

Such a simple seeming change appears overly complex, but i need to look further into it. 

Thx for your help so far.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2012 00:39:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/593/mod-1-d-config/?comment=595#comment-595</guid></item></channel></rss>
