Needless to say that this is very annoying. Is there a quickfix for this? 

BTW: im using i3 on a W530 laptop with a 1920x1080 display hooked up to it via the displayport.

Most applications however don't. These programs seem to think the entire width of both screens should be used when displaying popups. I was figuring if there was a way for i3 to simulate a single screen.</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 17:19:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2672/floating-windows-showing-up-in-the-middle-of-a-dualscreen-setup/?comment=2674#comment-2674</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;The placing of floating windows is dictated by the application.

XRandR in fact works in such a way that you have one big display and then the apps need to be smart about where the monitor boundaries are. If your app doesn’t do it, you need to fix it. There is no other way.</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 21:34:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2672/floating-windows-showing-up-in-the-middle-of-a-dualscreen-setup/?comment=2677#comment-2677</guid></item></channel></rss>
