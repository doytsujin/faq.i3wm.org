 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/169/how-do-i-start-a-new-program-tabbed-or-stacked/?answer=170#post-id-170</link><description>I did find the answer myself, but others might benefit:

There is no need to open the program before converting the container to tabbed/stacked. That is:

 1. Split the window in a direction
 2. Convert it to tabbed/stacked (does not result in any visual change)
 3. Launch the new program, it will launch in a tab/stacked

One can probably use i3-msg to create a short program that makes it a single commmand, instead of two.

A design question related to that would be: Why is there a difference between a "splitting layout" and "layout"?</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 18:14:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/169/how-do-i-start-a-new-program-tabbed-or-stacked/?answer=170#post-id-170</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I did find the answer myself, but others might benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the link to the bug report. I think making it 4 container layout modes, like you proposed, would be best.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:50:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/169/how-do-i-start-a-new-program-tabbed-or-stacked/?comment=172#comment-172</guid></item></channel></rss>
