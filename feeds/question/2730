This is a good way to keep a good quality and disallow the bots to mess up with it. Moreover at the beginning you have enough to do what you need: ask/answer questions and consult answers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2013 01:36:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2730/why-does-the-faq-use-such-restrictive-privileges/?comment=2737#comment-2737</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;There are several questions I'd like to upvote (such as #2458), but we can't upvote questions without having 10 karma.

When asking this question, I had assumed that because there was so little activity on the faq, even getting that one upvote would be a challenge, but now I've had three, so I guess I just wasn't patient enough.</description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 18:52:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2730/why-does-the-faq-use-such-restrictive-privileges/?comment=2782#comment-2782</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;There are several questions I'd like to upvote (such as #2458), but we can't upvote questions without having 10 karma.

Had the same problem some weeks ago. I felt like some kind of kind of second class member. Everything I wanted to do I just was not able to (upvote, post links..)

I feel your pain ;-)
