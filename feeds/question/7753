Just playing around with i3, on Ubuntu running in VMWare on Win 10. 

I appears that most people recommend using the win key as the mod key. That seems to work for me because it frees up alt for application menus. 

Alas, mod-l (for moving focus up) now locks my windows session. 

Any tips to work around this?

So, you should check whether 'mod-l' triggers something on host OS or in VMWare.</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 09:20:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7753/disable-windows-locking/?comment=7755#comment-7755</guid></item></channel></rss>
