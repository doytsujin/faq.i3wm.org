I use [pdfpc](https://davvil.github.io/pdfpc/) for presentations, i.e., ideally my PDF slides are shown in full screen on the projector (VGA1) while the presenters notes are shown on my laptop display (LVDS1).

When using pdfpc and i3 with two displays, it does not work as expected. Either I see only the presenter notes on ONE display and nothing on the other or I see the full-screen slides on ONE display and nothing on the other.

Is that me or a bug in i3?</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 12:46:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3965/dual-screen-presentation-does-not-work/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by farnerup for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3965/dual-screen-presentation-does-not-work/?answer=4862#post-id-4862</link><description>I had the same problem with dspdfviewer. Turns out it opens both windows in the same workspace. If you leave full-screen mode you will be able to see both windows, then move one of them to the correct screen and make both full-screen again.

I added the following to my config file to make them start in different workspaces:

    assign [title="DS PDF Viewer - Audience Window"] 2
    assign [title="DS PDF Viewer - Secondary Window"] 1
