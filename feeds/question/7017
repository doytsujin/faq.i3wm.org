More specifically I want to have 10 workspaces on each monitor, have each set of them numbered 1-10, and use the same shortcuts for each set but only change the change the workspace on the active monitor. 

I know I could essentially get what I want by just using different names and shortcuts but I'd like to know if it's possible to do it the way I described.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 21:58:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7017/make-workspaces-behave-like-awesome/</guid></item></channel></rss>
