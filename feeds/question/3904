i recently installed xubuntu 14.04 with i3 from the repos (4.7.2-1).
The problem i have is, that some icons show up in i3's tray such as Dropbox and xfce4-power-manager but others do not like nm-applet or shutter and keepassx. They do run however, and when i launch xfce4-panel, they show up in that panels tray (while Dropbox and xfce4-power-manager are only in the i3 bar)

Here's a screenshot: h_ttp://i.imgur.com/9X46vwC.png (i3bar on top, xfce4-panel rigth below)

Any idea what could cause this ? 

Thank you !</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 10:26:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3904/missing-icons-in-system-tray/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Man from Mars for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I have no specific options in my i3status.conf file to disable tray area on secondary monitor. Weird thing is that sometimes tray icons are on the main screen, some times on the secondary one.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 18:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3904/missing-icons-in-system-tray/?comment=3906#comment-3906</guid></item><item><title>Answer by jo3kr for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I had to disable "Indicator-Application" in the XFCE Autostart list.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 09:07:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3904/missing-icons-in-system-tray/?answer=3923#post-id-3923</guid></item></channel></rss>
