Also, i3-wsbar is deprecated. Its pure existance shows that you use an old version of i3. Can you please upgrade to 4.3 and try again?</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 10:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/663/i-cant-get-i3bar-or-i3-wsbar-to-display-anything/?answer=664#post-id-664</guid></item></channel></rss>
