And there's py3status plugin for showing mpd status in i3status.

And as a general advice - first look into py3status ([http://github.com/ultrabug/py3status](http://github.com/ultrabug/py3status)) or other i3status wrapper, because writting modules for vanilla i3status is quite a challenge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 06:41:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4659/i3status-showing-artist-and-album-infos-from-moc/?answer=4671#post-id-4671</guid></item></channel></rss>
