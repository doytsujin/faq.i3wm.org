I am really enjoying i3 which allows to manage all with my keyboard. I3 is a mouse killer ;-) Nevertheless I am a developper and when I test my software, I would like to launch my apps in floatting mode. The first solution consist on using windows classes, but I find that process quite heavy for some quick testing.
 
Would there be any way to launch an app in floating mode using command line ?
 
I am thinking about something roughly in this  fashion:
    i3-msg floatting myapp
 
Thanks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 19:22:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/895/use-command-line-to-launch-app-in-floatting-mode/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Theoretically, this would be technically possible as long as the app supports startup notifications. However, i3 is for tiling windows, not floating. Therefore I wouldn’t accept such a patch.

Use the window classes or — possibly, depending on your use case — stacked/tabbed mode.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 19:30:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/895/use-command-line-to-launch-app-in-floatting-mode/?answer=896#post-id-896</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Saorel for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
