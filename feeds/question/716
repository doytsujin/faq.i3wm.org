I've asked myself if there are plans to implement a possibility to send a command to all containers of a tab or someting like this. I don't know if someone uses terminator as terminal emulator. I like its option "group all in tab". That's very handy, especially when dealing with up to 20 ssh session and must execute the same stuff.

cssh can manage this but if starting cssh with 20 windows all in splith or splitv is not pretty usable.

This feature would be really great! imho

cheers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 01:04:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/716/send-command-to-mult-terms/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;hey,&lt;/p&gt;

Do you mean "send an i3 command such as resize the window", or do you mean "send an SSH command/keyboard input to the application"?</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 15:44:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/716/send-command-to-mult-terms/?comment=727#comment-727</guid></item><item><title>Comment by i3-tiler for &lt;p&gt;hey,&lt;/p&gt;

The idea was to have some kind of clusterssh functionality. Using clusterssh itself has the disadvantage that all terms are either splith _or_ splitv.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 22:17:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/716/send-command-to-mult-terms/?comment=827#comment-827</guid></item><item><title>Answer by fernandotcl for &lt;p&gt;hey,&lt;/p&gt;
