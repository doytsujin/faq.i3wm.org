 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?answer=7688#post-id-7688</link><description>I've finally got back to this issue. The following i3 bindsym are the answer to my question.

    bindsym --whole-window $mod+button4 workspace next_on_output
    bindsym --whole-window $mod+button5 workspace prev_on_output

The problem was i was use MOUSE instead of BUTTON, which i3 didn't see as a wrong key or unknow key.  This will only work when a windows is active on the workspace.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 14:09:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?answer=7688#post-id-7688</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I've finally got back to this issue.

This only works when there is a window on the workspace. For empty workspaces, this will work only once #2097 is implemented (patch is pending) and then starting with i3 4.12.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 14:37:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?comment=7690#comment-7690</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I want to scroll through my open workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

You may want to use "next\_on\_output" and "prev\_on\_output" to fully mirror the i3bar behavior. </description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 14:57:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?answer=7531#post-id-7531</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Just bind those keys to "workspace next" and "workspace prev".  &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?comment=7548#comment-7548</link><description>It works fine for me. Make sure you are running the latest version of i3 (4.11, run i3 --version to find out). Also note that the binding only works on a window â€“ it won't work when the mouse is on an empty workspace.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 20:32:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?comment=7548#comment-7548</guid></item><item><title>Comment by luytsm for &lt;p&gt;Just bind those keys to "workspace next" and "workspace prev".  &lt;/p&gt;

This keybind is not working. What am I doing wrong?</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 19:39:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7528/scrolling-trough-workspaces/?comment=7546#comment-7546</guid></item></channel></rss>
