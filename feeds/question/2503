The `ppt` value is optional, but the `px` value is mandatory. Since you don't specify it, I guess i3 uses the default value, which is (as also specified in the documentation) 10 pixels, for both of your statements.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 12:42:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2503/resize-with-i3-msg/?answer=2513#post-id-2513</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;According to the documentation, section "Resizing containers/windows" (cannot link to it because of insufficient karma…), I would assume that you are using the wrong syntax here: It is &lt;code&gt;resize &amp;lt;grow|shrink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;direction&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;px&amp;gt; px [or &amp;lt;ppt&amp;gt; ppt]]&lt;/code&gt;.

I just tried pasting the exact line from my conf for resize (which I swear to god I thought I tried) and it worked properly. It should really return an error on bad syntax rather than use a default value.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 19:39:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2503/resize-with-i3-msg/?comment=2514#comment-2514</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joek1010 for &lt;p&gt;According to the documentation, section "Resizing containers/windows" (cannot link to it because of insufficient karma…), I would assume that you are using the wrong syntax here: It is &lt;code&gt;resize &amp;lt;grow|shrink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;direction&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;px&amp;gt; px [or &amp;lt;ppt&amp;gt; ppt]]&lt;/code&gt;.
