This method is quite useful to separate the projects I am working into different workspaces. Every time I finish  project 1 input in workspace 1 and expect new windows comming in 10 minutes, I can switch to workspace 2 and work on project 2. Currnetly, without the desired function, all the new windows associated with project 1 will appear at workspace 2 (sincei am working on that during the 10 min waiting), mixing up windows associated with project 2, and vise versa.

If you want this to work only for a specific window type (gvim), you can create a json layout somewhere:

    {
        "name": "gvim will be here one day",
        "swallows": [
           {
           "class": "????",
           "instance": "????",
           "window_role": "????"
           }
        ],
        "type": "con"
    }

where you have to figure out yourself what to replace `????` with, using for instance `xprop`. You can also skip some of the properties. Then whenever you want to run gvim, you have to:

 1. Call `i3-msg "append_layout /full_path_to/your_layout_file"` to load the layout.
 2. Run gvim.

The hope is the when gvim eventually starts, its window is consumed by the loaded layout. 

**Downsides:** 

 - The layout window is loaded on the top level of the current workspace, not where the focus currently is. I can imagine someone automatically moving the layout window to the scratchpad and then immediately back to where the focus is. This seems doable, but would require more work.

 - If your application has an unpredictable number of windows, you should probably move them automatically to the scratchpad and then write a script that moves them back to the the proper workspace (once it gets focused, I don't think you can do this before). This would require way more scripting and in particular subscribing to i3 events!</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 05:01:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6175/how-to-make-the-new-window-popout-from-the-workspace-where-it-is-called/?answer=6176#post-id-6176</guid></item></channel></rss>
