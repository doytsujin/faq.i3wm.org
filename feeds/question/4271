I install I3 (via apt-get (on ubuntu 14.04 server)) and some vnc client, what else do I actually need to get it working? (something like xorg? Or X11? Or some kind of combopackage with them all in?)

I've somehow managed to get startx to work, and i3 to exec, and vnc to work, but all of the keybindings are broken (they all say $mod + null in the config) so I'm trying to work out what I might be missing in my incredibly haphazard mash-install of a system. :D

Edit - When I load up vnc, it gives me an error message with the options to show errors or edit config at the top, show errors just gives a big list of:
"ERROR: Duplicate keybinding in config file: modmask 8 with keysym (null), command "focus up"

I've tried manually adding the keys in TNA (for example, changing new terminal to alt + enter just maximises the current container (nano for example) instead of making a new container.

Yes I know I don't need it, it is a headless server. The point is I want to know Why it doesn't work before I don't use it from not needing it. ;)</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 01:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4271/what-is-actually-required-for-i3-to-run/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;So say I have a headless server.

If there is no need to have a graphical layer running at the server (which it does not sound like), don't do it. </description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 15:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4271/what-is-actually-required-for-i3-to-run/?comment=4287#comment-4287</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;So say I have a headless server.
