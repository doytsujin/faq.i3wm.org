There is just one Thing that bugs me, and I can't seem to find a way around it.
Frequently I need to use XFreeRDP for work, I have the Modifier set to Mod4(WindowsKey)
because I use Emacs, so I can't use ALT. Apparently If I start xfreerdp in fullscreen-mode, I'm not able to quit it or switch workspaces, I'm stuck in the RDP-Session till I log out.

Anybody an Idea for a Workaround to this Problem?</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 10:08:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4199/i3wm-mod4-and-xfreerdp/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;So I just installed i3wm on ArchLinux and overall I find it quite awesome ;-)

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4199/i3wm-mod4-and-xfreerdp/?answer=4201#post-id-4201</link><description>for rdesktop i can press `[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Enter]` to leave fullscreen mode.
When rdesktop window is not fullscreen anymore the normal i3 keyboard shortcuts are working.

I guess there must be a shortcut to leave/toggle fullscreen mode for XFreeRDP as well.
A quick google search revealed this to try: `[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Break]`

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4199/i3wm-mod4-and-xfreerdp/?answer=5428#post-id-5428</link><description>While this is an old question, I wanted to post my workaround: if you use "-grab-keyboard" as an option to xfreerdp, it will not capture your i3 keyboard shortcuts even in full screen mode. I just remapped a few things to not conflict and can use all of my shortcuts in both rdp and out.

A note, though - if you use an i3 shortcut while in xfreerdp, sometimes it will see the KeyDown on Mod4 but not the KeyUp. If this happens things will get weird, as it will act like you're holding down Mod4 at all times within the session. If this does happen, just tap Mod4 once while in the RDP window and it will go back to normal.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2015 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4199/i3wm-mod4-and-xfreerdp/?answer=5428#post-id-5428</guid></item></channel></rss>
