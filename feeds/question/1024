I have spent several hours trying different notification daemons with pop up windows in i3 and I haven't found any as aesthetically pleasing as the standard notification-daemon.  I am able to get the daemon to run (/usr/libexec/notification-daemon) but when using notify-send the popups happen all over the screen, and in many cases off the screen (I can tell because I see about 15 or so pixels of the bubble popup).  Any thoughts on why the results are so sporadic and how I can get this working in i3?   Or do you suggest any good notification engines?  

P.s. I tried dunst and a hacky notify-osd...neither of which I liked.

Thanks in advance!

I've user notification-daemon for quite some time. </description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 02:52:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1024/using-gnome-notification-daemon-in-i3/?comment=1047#comment-1047</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

Gnome-shell seems a requirement to attach a keybinding to toggle show-hide events menu.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2013 00:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1024/using-gnome-notification-daemon-in-i3/?comment=1368#comment-1368</guid></item><item><title>Answer by sml for &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

Both work well on i3 and provide the minimum features I need:

* icon support
* active monitor support (popup on the monitor you're working on, for multi-monitor setups)
* configurable position to any corner of the screen</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 11:21:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1024/using-gnome-notification-daemon-in-i3/?answer=4240#post-id-4240</guid></item></channel></rss>
