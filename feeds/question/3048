Please post a bug report on http://bugs.i3wm.org. If you can find steps to reproduce the issue, it will help me fix it.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 05:55:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?comment=3049#comment-3049</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cneumann for &lt;p&gt;The focus commands will focus "hidden" windows (i.e. windows in a tabbed container which are not selected) in a container.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?comment=3054#comment-3054</link><description>You are right. I mean windows which are not visible in a container with tab layout.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 11:44:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?comment=3054#comment-3054</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cneumann for &lt;p&gt;The focus commands will focus "hidden" windows (i.e. windows in a tabbed container which are not selected) in a container.

The "hidden" windows I sometimes see are literally hidden (not mapped by the rendering server) but can sometimes subtly affect the movement of windows.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 09:55:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?comment=3051#comment-3051</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;The focus commands will focus "hidden" windows (i.e. windows in a tabbed container which are not selected) in a container.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?answer=3056#post-id-3056</link><description>I have the following in my config: 

    bindsym $mod+Control+Left focus parent; focus left

Not too satisfied with it, as it should behave differently in tabbed/stacked containers as in normal ones. </description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 21:24:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3048/change-focus-to-visible-windows/?answer=3056#post-id-3056</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cneumann for &lt;p&gt;I have the following in my config: &lt;/p&gt;
