Due to character of the information--it's basically a guess, and due to the fact that most batteries won't last more than 9 hours, the format is a bit too verbose (I'm referring to the seconds part, and the implicit zero before hour, respectively).

It would be nice if one could specify the precision, or the format so that the information does not cut more from the costly status bar space.

In my own opinion, unpadded hour and minute (`%-H:%m` in date(1), e.g. "1:05" for hour and 5 minutes remaining) would suffice; it could be even used as default.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:31:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5668/minute-precision-for-battery-remaining-and-emptytime/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;Currently, the battery module's &lt;code&gt;%remaining&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%emptytime&lt;/code&gt;show time in precision "hh:mm:ss", that is, 2-digit numbers for hours, minutes and seconds.
