If you already have one, strace i3-dmenu-desktop to find out where it’s spending its time. Maybe there is a directly with a lot of .desktop files on your machine.

There also is https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop, which is written in C++ and should be a lot faster.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2013 19:10:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2987/i3-dmenu-desktop-is-taking-1-or-2-seconds-to-load/?answer=2988#post-id-2988</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TechyCluster for &lt;p&gt;Get an SSD for faster random file access.

It was some kind of cache. I removed it and i3-dmenu-desktop is a bit faster but it still takes a second to load. I' going to try j4-dmenu-desktop.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2013 19:42:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2987/i3-dmenu-desktop-is-taking-1-or-2-seconds-to-load/?answer=2990#post-id-2990</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TechyCluster for &lt;p&gt;I decided to run &lt;code&gt;find / -name "*.desktop"&lt;/code&gt; and I found a directory &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/app-install/desktop&lt;/code&gt; full of desktop files of applications that I don't have installed.
