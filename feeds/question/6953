Mouse never shows the watch icon when an application is being loaded. (Dmenu, i3wm's shortcuts, etc). Instead I get just the normal pointer all the time. In a normal Unity session I get it right. This is a minor issue but I'm curious about. Any help is appreciated. </description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2015 16:00:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6953/mouse-never-shows-the-watch-waiting-state/</guid></item></channel></rss>
