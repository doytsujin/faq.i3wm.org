This causes issues when using mod4/super as the mod key.

Are there any recommendations for what mod key/key combination to use so that I am not doing funky stuff in windows while trying to use i3 key bindings?

Example: 
I have my mod key set to super, so mod+1 switch to 'workspace 1'... as it should...
If I am on a VNC window, and I do this, it opens the start menu on the VNC machine, and then switches to 'workspace 1' (leaving the start menu open.)

to get around this, I open another window in the same workspace as the VNC window (Usually urxvt) click on it, then I am free to use the super key with out messing with windows.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 19:45:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3270/using-windows-systems-in-vnc-or-vm-with-windows-keysupermod4/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I use VNC, and Windows Virtual Machines on a regular basis.

This works because I don't use 'Capslock' and don't have an actual Hyper_L button and windows doesn't use it. 

Not sure how much I like it... but it works...

I think this is the way to do it: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216893

I happen to use Win-L to lock my PC on a regular basis, and unfortunately it appears that there's no easy way to lock it if this is not enabled, so I keep this one shortcut enabled. I use Vim-like movement keys (`hjkl` instead of `jkl;`), so this means that moving my focus to the right causes the PC to lock. To avoid this, I have made a duplicate mapping of Win-o to also move focus right.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2014 18:37:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3270/using-windows-systems-in-vnc-or-vm-with-windows-keysupermod4/?answer=3375#post-id-3375</guid></item><item><title>Comment by BatmanAoD for &lt;p&gt;You should be able to disable all of the Windows shortcuts that use the Windows key; this way you won't have a conflict.

I just switched my mod key, was the simpler solution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2014 18:51:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3270/using-windows-systems-in-vnc-or-vm-with-windows-keysupermod4/?comment=3376#comment-3376</guid></item></channel></rss>
