 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4853/cant-set-i3-sensible-terminal-to-terminology/?answer=4854#post-id-4854</link><description>Set TERMINAL before starting i3, e.g. in your `~/.xsession` if you start i3 from `~/.xsession`.

You could also just replace all calls to i3-sensible-terminal with terminology directly, since i3-sensible-terminal has no other function than to find a working terminal emulator.

If you’re on Debian (or derivatives), you can also use `update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator` to set the default terminal emulator.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 21:45:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4853/cant-set-i3-sensible-terminal-to-terminology/?answer=4854#post-id-4854</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Deus Deceit for &lt;p&gt;Set TERMINAL before starting i3, e.g. in your &lt;code&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/code&gt; if you start i3 from &lt;code&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm using Arch Linux and it doesn't recognize that as command.
