When I start the computer, the system does not automatically log into i3. Instead, it loads openbox. What I do then to load i3 is that I log out, press F1, and log back in. Any thoughts how can I fix it so that it loads i3 every time I start the computer? I am running Crunchbang Waldorf.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 13:02:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5599/loggin-in-directly-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Vlad for &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Or, if ~/.xinitrc is not present, create it and add "exec i3" line to it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 01:14:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5599/loggin-in-directly-i3/?comment=5604#comment-5604</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Oposum for &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

    exec i3

in your .xinitrc will help you.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 13:11:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5599/loggin-in-directly-i3/?comment=5600#comment-5600</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Oposum for &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

How can I log in automatically? 2. It loads some strange wallpaper that it keeps in i3 - how can I change it?</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 00:11:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5599/loggin-in-directly-i3/?comment=5617#comment-5617</guid></item><item><title>Comment by topernic for &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

If you install lightdm you should then have the option to boot i3 or openbox.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 21:36:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5599/loggin-in-directly-i3/?comment=5610#comment-5610</guid></item></channel></rss>
