[Vadim Atlygin](http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/2012-June/000716.html) worked on integrating i3 in emacs, *certainly* by, somehow, delegating the execution of these commands to `i3` through IPC messages.


However, I can't get it working, and I don't know emacs enough to be able to fix anything in his code.

Any idea how to install it propertly ?, anything else than that:

    (require 'i3)
    (require 'i3-integration)
    (i3-one-window-per-frame-mode-on)
    (i3-advise-visible-frame-list-on)

Any idea what's wrong ? maybe it's just version conflicts ?

Putting those files in your ~/.emacs.d folder and adding:

    (require 'i3)
    (require 'i3-integration)
    (i3-one-window-per-frame-mode-on)
    (i3-advise-visible-frame-list-on)

To your .emacs should be enough. If you are receiving start-up errors try running Emacs with the --debug-init flag and post the backtrace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2013 05:31:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1273/i3-and-emacs-integration/?answer=1297#post-id-1297</guid></item><item><title>Comment by npostavs for &lt;p&gt;What's the error you are receiving?&lt;/p&gt;
