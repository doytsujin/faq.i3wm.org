Let say to whole workspace. So basically I type in a command like `ssh some-outside-host.com -luser` and then all my windows inside current workspace will fire up ssh and connect to that outside host. Basically I would like a similar functionality as broadcasting in terminator.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 08:47:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6996/broadcasting-to-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I would like to broadcast my input to multiple windows at the same time.

If your primary concern is SSH, you may want to have a look at Cluster SSH (cssh). cssh opens a terminal to each host given, you can give the same host multiple times. Input can then go to all terminals or just a subset. You can also use each terminal on its own.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 09:40:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6996/broadcasting-to-workspace/?comment=6997#comment-6997</guid></item></channel></rss>
