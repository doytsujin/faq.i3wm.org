The [command to change the border style is `border`](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_border_style).

So, in order to set the `normal` border style only for some applications, you want to use:

    for_window [class="Emacs"] border normal
    for_window [class="Copyq"] border normal

This will set the border of any (floating *or* tiled) window that matches the criteria. So Emacs will have a normal border even if it is tiled. But in contrast to the [`new_float` option](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_border_style_for_new_windows) this *will* work even if the window does not start out as floating.

As you mentioned, that you use these applications in floating mode, you can even combine setting the border style with sending the window to the floating layer:

    for_window [class="Emacs"] floating enable, border normal
    for_window [class="Copyq"] floating enable, border normal

----

If you want to have certain windows to have another border style only when floating or if you want all floating windows to have the same border style (but differnt from tiled windows), you'll have to use [*i3's* IPC interface](http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_window_event) and listen to window events sent when a window transitions from tiled to floating or vice versa.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2015 07:37:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5977/how-to-set-the-new_window-property-for-cherry-picked-applications/?answer=5989#post-id-5989</guid></item><item><title>Comment by msx for &lt;p&gt;The issue here is that &lt;code&gt;new_window&lt;/code&gt; is a configuration option and &lt;code&gt;for_window&lt;/code&gt; expects a command.

&lt;p&gt;So, in order to set the &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt; border style only for some applications, you want to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_window [class="Emacs"] border normal
for_window [class="Copyq"] border normal
