I'd like to change the default orientation such that new windows (or whatever they're called) split the screen horizontally -- one on top, one at the bottom. How do I do that? I've tried adding

default_orientation horizontal

to ~/.i3/config, but it doesn't seem to change anything. I'm using Debian 7.1 (maybe something's awry with file permissions? I'll try chmod +x).</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 21:05:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2375/how-do-i-change-the-default-orientation/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by badboy_ for &lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;

I'll cite the [userguide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_orientation_for_new_workspaces)

&gt; New workspaces get a reasonable default orientation: Wide-screen monitors (anything 
&gt; wider than high) get horizontal orientation, rotated monitors (anything higher than wide)
&gt; get vertical orientation.
&gt; With the default_orientation configuration directive, you can override that behaviour.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 09:58:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2375/how-do-i-change-the-default-orientation/?answer=2386#post-id-2386</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;Did you try &lt;code&gt;default_orientation vertical&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

    exec i3-msg split v

&lt;br/&gt;It seems to work for me.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 07:37:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2375/how-do-i-change-the-default-orientation/?answer=2378#post-id-2378</guid></item></channel></rss>
