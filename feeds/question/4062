 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4062/which-notification-tool-is-i3-using-by-default/?answer=4065#post-id-4065</link><description>badboy_ is right. Ubuntu based Systems use the command `notify-send` for desktop messages to be displayed. By default Ubuntu uses the `notify-osd` daemon to display the messages. It seems that `~/.notify-osd` is used for its configuration however I didn't find a link with a howto. 

You can use other notification daemons instead. I prefer [dunst](http://www.knopwob.org/dunst/) over it, but there are others, see [here](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/121/whats-a-good-notification-daemon-for-i3/).

In order to run a different daemon I have the following lines in my i3 config:

    exec killall -q notify-osd
    exec --no-startup-id dunst -config ~/.i3/config_dunst

This exchanges the daemons.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2014 13:44:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4062/which-notification-tool-is-i3-using-by-default/?answer=4065#post-id-4065</guid></item></channel></rss>
