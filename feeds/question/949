Then, you can use something like "workspace 1; workspace 6" as command to switch both workspaces at once.

Or you just adapt to the way i3 works ;-).</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2012 12:46:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/949/dont-share-workspaces-between-monitors/?answer=950#post-id-950</guid></item></channel></rss>
