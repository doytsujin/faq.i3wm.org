Adding this to i3's `config` file (in `~/.i3` or `~/.config/i3`), works like a charm:

    exec --no-startup-id /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon

Tested with Ubuntu 12.04.

As a bonus, it makes Ubuntu fonts display a lot better (otherwise, Ubuntu Mono, as an example, displays uglier than within an Ubuntu session).

I've followed the instructions there, and also I've added this line in my config file:

    exec xrdb -load .Xdefaults

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4077/colour-management-and-icc-profiles/?answer=5549#post-id-5549</link><description>I've been looking this today in Ubuntu 14.04 onwards the command would be:

    exec --no-startup-id /usr/bin/unity-settings-daemon

PD. I'm looking for how to do this in a *dual screen* setup outside the Ubuntu/GNOME world and I'm quite lost. Any help is appreciated.

PD2. I've found the answer in this thread [1] for doing it without the unity settings daemon, the argyll package must be installed and the command would be:

    dispwin -d &lt;screen number, 1 or 2 in my case, listed by the utility&gt; -I &lt;profile&gt;
