While mounting drives on i3, I get the following error message: "Unable to mount name_of_the_drive. Authentication is required."
Therefore, I cannot mount any drive. But while in GNOME, when I click to open any drive, a dialog box appears asking for user password. The drive mounts when I give the password. But here in i3, no dialog box appears asking for password, nor it mount the drive. So what should I do?</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 19:49:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4054/unable-to-mount-drive-authentication-is-required/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I'm using i3 on top of Debian 7 GNOME.

It would actually probably be best to search on the forums or mailing list of your distribution of choice, as there may be ready-to-install solutions available to you. You could of course just use the "mount" command as root from a terminal.

EDIT: I cut out my longer answer, since I misread the initial question. </description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 13:42:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4054/unable-to-mount-drive-authentication-is-required/?answer=4080#post-id-4080</guid></item></channel></rss>
