I'm using a simple bash script which actually works just with i3-msg calls. I start that script with exec in ~/.i3/config. I'm sure it could be improved on some parts but it works for me and is simple to read. (The only thing you must not do is play around with the mouse while the layout is created. Otherwise your focus will get somewhere else and the layout is not like you wanted it.)

That really could be because when I tested it without the sleep time between the result was never like I expected.
