as stated above you can specify

&lt;pre&gt;for_window [class='Urxvt'] floating enable&lt;/pre&gt;

then specify a keybinding
&lt;pre&gt;bindsym $MOD+Enter exec urxvt -g 78x24&lt;/pre&gt;

and / or specify a position on the screen
&lt;pre&gt;
bindysm $MOD+Enter exec urxvt -g [height]x[width][+,-]x[+,-]y
bindsym $MOD+Enter exec urxvt -g 78x24+50+20
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above will put in in the upper left

That will not work with Audacious for example.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:53:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/970/how-to-open-a-program-to-float-mode-with-specific-dimensions/?comment=1452#comment-1452</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;As the title says. :)

    # autostart urxvt with instance set to "foo"
    exec urxvtc -name foo
    
    for_window [instance="^foo$"] floating enable

Also make sure you know about the scratchpad functionality (see the userguide), maybe that already does what you want (you don’t specify what you want…)</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2013 23:43:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/970/how-to-open-a-program-to-float-mode-with-specific-dimensions/?answer=975#post-id-975</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Zucca for &lt;p&gt;You can use urxvt’s -name property and then match on that:&lt;/p&gt;
