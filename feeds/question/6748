I'm using i3 4.8 on Slackware 14.1 and everything is working perfectly except for one small issue. On the rare occasion when I exit i3 with Shift+Mod+e, then log back in, the nagbar shows up again and then I must close it. This happens when logging back into i3 or a different environment such as xfce. It isn't a big deal because it doesn't cause any problems but I would like to diagnose and fix it. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 23:26:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6748/nagbar-re-appears-when-logging-back-in/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;Hi thanks for the excellent wm, love it.

I've tried and seen a couple forum posts about not being able to build 4.10 or greater. I'll try again and look into the errors. Thank you.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2015 12:41:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6748/nagbar-re-appears-when-logging-back-in/?comment=6868#comment-6868</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi thanks for the excellent wm, love it.

There's just no official support regarding bugs. Or did updating solve it?</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 17:49:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6748/nagbar-re-appears-when-logging-back-in/?comment=6766#comment-6766</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;Hi thanks for the excellent wm, love it.

I used the packages available from the Slackbuilds.org site but will attempt to upgrade i3. Still new to Slackware so may take me some time. Thank you.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 01:03:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6748/nagbar-re-appears-when-logging-back-in/?comment=6756#comment-6756</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi thanks for the excellent wm, love it.

Often bugs have been fixed in the meantime.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 05:49:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6748/nagbar-re-appears-when-logging-back-in/?comment=6750#comment-6750</guid></item></channel></rss>
