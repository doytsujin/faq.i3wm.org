 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/58/how-can-we-move-focus-between-tiling-and-floating-windows/?answer=59#post-id-59</link><description>This wm is amazing... I ended up finding the answer when writing this question... (laughs). It is defined in .i3/config (by default) as:

    # toggle tiling / floating
    bindsym $mod+Shift+space floating toggle

    # change focus between tiling / floating windows
    bindsym $mod+space focus mode_toggle

So to move the focus from floating to tiled windows, use $mod+Shift+space!
