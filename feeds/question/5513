I know there is the option `-corners` that prevents xautolock from locking if the mouse cursor is in that corner, but that would need me to remind this every time I'm in fullscreen.

It would be suitable for me if there is any other program with similar functionality as xautolock offers, and does not lock when in fullscreen mode or watching fullscreen videos.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 20:57:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5513/prevent-xautolock-from-locking-while-being-in-fullscreen/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;Is there any way to prevent xautolock from locking while watching videos (either in browser or mplayer/vlc) or being in fullscreen mode?&lt;/p&gt;

Also found a bash script that I could adopt to use xdotool whenever a player or youtube is in fullscreen. Will post an answer when I have it running.
