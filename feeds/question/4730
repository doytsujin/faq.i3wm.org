However I also need the program to be able to not float when opened normally. 

Very simliar to question: 4550, launch-in-floating-mode 

(sorry for not linking, not enough karma to post links.), however I can't just match on an instance type, since I only want it to float sometimes.
Specifically, I use sublime text to do text edits, as well as edit git commit messages. I'd like to have the git commits float (as to not disrupt my current layout).

Here's the xprop output from both examples
### commit message

_NET_WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "_NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER(CARDINAL) = 35652881 • - Sublime Text (UNREGISTERED)"
```

The only relevant difference I noticed was that the WM_NAME contained `COMMIT_EDITMSG`. However I'm unsure how to invoke `floating enable` on a partial name. 

I also figured I might just edit the xproperties with xprop to solve my problem (and match on window_role), but, now after a few tries, I'm not even sure that's something you can reasonably do (I honestly don't have an understanding of these things).
Running `xprop -set window_role popup` and clicking sublime caused this as output
`xprop: error: unsupported conversion for window_role`. I'm also not entirely sure how I'd determine window Id of a newly launched window in order to alter *its* properties specifically.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has a solution. Preferably one I could use on other applications when needed, I'm alright with making separate shell scripts altering xprops for running an app in floating mode.

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/bin/subl3 -n -w $@
    i3-msg '[title="COMMIT_EDITMSG"] floating enable'

So, first launch subl3 with a new window (-n) and wait for file to close before exiting process (-w). Then msg i3 to have it float any windows containing the text COMMIT_EDITMSG in the title.</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 02:51:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4730/launch-program-floating/?answer=4734#post-id-4734</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Well, I apparently suck at reading documentation.
