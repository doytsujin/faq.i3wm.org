I have made a script (used for debugging a multi-user web portal) to run multiple instances of Firefox (each with its own profile). Is it possible to specify the workspace when starting a program from the terminal/script, so I am able to e.g. start the first 10 instances in workspace 1, the next 10 instances in workspace 2 etc.?

bash-script: 
for i in {1..40; do sleep 0.1; firefox -p $i -new-instance "website.com/login" &amp; done

Kind regards, Morten</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 10:43:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4656/shell-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

As there is no real additional content here deleting it soon should not be an issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 06:26:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4656/shell-workspace/?comment=4670#comment-4670</guid></item><item><title>Answer by MortenJ for &lt;p&gt;Hi,
