I'm really loving i3 so far. I've been using it on my desktop a lot and I feel like it's just a great option for productivity. I installed it on my laptop as well but I'm getting a few problems on it that I'm not getting on the desktop.

Basically, whenever I close the lid on my laptop (and I close it pretty frequently, you know, to move around), i3 just completely crashes. Not only that, but all of my keyboard combinations stop working for some reason, so I couldn't even open dmenu to boot it back up. Even my terminals are crashed so I'm left with no option but to reboot.

I'm using xfce4 as my session manager (the OS is xubuntu). It's the exact same install as the desktop, but with this strange new problem.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 12:40:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4842/i3-crashes-on-suspend/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by peterN for &lt;p&gt;Hi.

Just the login manager, which would actually lightdm? Or do you use *i3* as window manager for a xfce4 session?</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 12:59:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4842/i3-crashes-on-suspend/?comment=4844#comment-4844</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Victory for &lt;p&gt;Hi.
