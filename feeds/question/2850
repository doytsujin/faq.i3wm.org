I suggest you install GDM or LightDM which is another DM and that should make it work.

if you have a file called .Xsession in your home directory add the line "exec i3" without the quotes. if u do not have the file .. create it. then from your TTY just type "startx" .. without the quotes .. i have ONLY i3 installed, i do not know how this will work if u have other WM's or DE's installed, for that you would likely have to look into default Xsession ... 
i found this here: wiki.ubuntu.com/CustomXSession.
section titled: Anatomy of a simple X session script
