i3wm generally lets users park their mouse, because it works nicely with keybinds. Is there a way to access the nagbar also without a mouse? I would like to press a nagbar button with Return or close it with Esc and focus and unfocus it from keyboard. Is there a way?</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 01:52:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6412/focus-nagbar-with-keyboard/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oberon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Those you can assign with a simple script like [**THIS**](https://github.com/manjaro/packages-community/blob/master/i3exit/i3exit)

In your **~.i3/config** you can use somehting like:

    # Set shut down, restart and locking features
    bindsym $mod+0 mode "$mode_system"
    set $mode_system (l)ock, (e)xit, switch_(u)ser, (s)uspend, (h)ibernate, (r)eboot, (Shift+s)hutdown
    mode "$mode_system" {
    bindsym l exec --no-startup-id i3exit lock, mode "default"
    bindsym s exec --no-startup-id i3exit suspend, mode "default"
    bindsym u exec --no-startup-id i3exit switch_user, mode "default"
    bindsym e exec --no-startup-id i3exit logout, mode "default"
    bindsym h exec --no-startup-id i3exit hibernate, mode "default"
    bindsym r exec --no-startup-id i3exit reboot, mode "default"
    bindsym Shift+s exec --no-startup-id i3exit shutdown, mode "default"

    # exit system mode: "Enter" or "Escape"
    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
