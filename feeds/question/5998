As per the [documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#mousebindings) I then added to my i3config:

    bindsym --whole-window button19 workspace prev
    bindsym --whole-window button17 workspace next

Swiping with three fingers is triggering these buttons (checked via xev), but i3 isn't switching my desktop.

This works if I use `sxhkd` -&gt; `i3-msg`, but I find that a bit hacky. What am I doing wrong? Did I miss something?</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2015 20:04:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5998/switching-desktops-with-three-finger-swipe/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;I've configured xorg to send three-finger swipes as mouse16, mouse17, mouse18 and mouse19 (top, right, bottom, left respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
