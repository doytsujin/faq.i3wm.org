Googling for the problem did get me hits but never answers which solved the problem.

The problem: at some point Firefox's dropdown menus stop working.  With these I mean the menus one gets when clicking on the menu bar ("File", "Edit", "View", etc.), the right click (context) menu in the browser window, the completion menu in the address bar and completion menus for forms.  I probably forgot some.

Since the log files never logged anything sensible tt finally occurred to me to see whether i3 logged any problems, and lo and behold after enabling logging for i3 I got this in `~/.xsession-errors`:

    2014-05-12 09:15:29 - main.c:xkb_got_event:153 - Handling XKB event
    2014-05-12 09:15:29 - handlers.c:handle_client_message:639 - Unknown atom in clientmessage of type 411
    2014-05-12 09:15:29 - handlers.c:handle_unmap_notify_event:454 - UnmapNotify for 0x014284c6 (received from 0x00000292), serial 64847

I have no idea what this means, but this is the same message I get when trying to activate any of the abovementioned menus.

This is with:
