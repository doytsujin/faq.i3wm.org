Key bindings such as `bindsym $mod+r mode "resize"` binds the physical key of `r` on pc105 (keycode 27) to resize. My issue is that I'm using a dvorak layout though; 

    ~ % setxkbmap -query |grep layout
    
    layout:     se_sv_dvorak,us

Using `xev` I see that when I press my physical `r`, it is mapped to `p` (as expected) and in the terminal a `p` is printed. However, in i3, I must now use this key to resize.

A few weeks back I was using `o` (keycode 32, mapped to `r` in my dvorak) for resize. 

My i3 configuration hasn't changed.

In fact, if I issue a configuration reload, key bindings take effect as expected and I can use keycode 32 for resize (physical `o`). It seems that the wrong keys are only being bound once at my first login after boot.

Are there any known changes to i3 that could have cause this?
