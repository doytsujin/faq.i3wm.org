I used to start up gnome-settings-daemon and the screen dimming and screensaver used to work fine in i3. Ever since the update to 14.04 the screen does not dim after the the set inactive time nor does the screensaver activate. The brightness adjustment keys work fine. Anyone come across this problem? Any solutions?
