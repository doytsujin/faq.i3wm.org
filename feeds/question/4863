I'm struggeling with the hotkeys for volume up / down and mute. Other Hotkeys like wifi on/off, brightness do work (Lenovo E325) I checked xev and it tells me for the not working keys:
&lt;pre&gt;
FocusOut event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x2400001,
    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor

FocusIn event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x2400001,
    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor

KeymapNotify event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x0,
    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   
           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 
&lt;/pre&gt;
The grab/ungrab part tells me, that it is used by another process? But which?
In Unity I have no problems using the keys. So I installed pa-applet and it tells me, that when i start it:
&lt;pre&gt;
Failed to grab XF86AudioRaiseVolume 

Failed to grab XF86AudioLowerVolume
&lt;/pre&gt;


actually the keys are bind correctly when i start a xterm w/o a wm. So the problem seems to be with i3.Any ideas?
Cheers

At hey are "swallowed" by the other program the only thing `xev` notices is that it lost the input focus for a very short time ("FocusOut", "FocusIn").

Please check if you have any `bindsym` bindings to `XF86AudioRaiseVolume` or `XF86AudioLowerVolume` in your `~/.i3/config` and remove/comment them. It could also be `bindcode` bindings. (For me the codes are `122` and `123` but that may differ depending on keyboard, layout and driver)

Also, if some other program already listens to those keys, they would also not be shown by `xev` and it could explain the error message you get from `pa-applet`. The most likely culprit would be another mixer or some media-player as many of them allow global keyboard shortcuts and would have reason to bind these keys.

Do you have a way to upload your `~/.i3/config`, `~/.xsession` and `~/.xsessionrc` (if they exists, that is)?  </description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 11:41:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4863/media-control-hotkeys-dont-work/?comment=4873#comment-4873</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tripe for &lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;i3&lt;/em&gt; or some other application is grabbing these keys.
