    # change focus
    bindsym $mod+h focus left
    bindsym $mod+j focus down
    bindsym $mod+k focus up
    bindsym $mod+l focus right

    # split in horizontal orientation
    bindsym $mod+Shift+v split h
    
    # split in vertical orientation
    bindsym $mod+v split v

    # resize window (you can also use the mouse for that)
    mode "resize" {
            # These bindings trigger as soon as you enter the resize mode
    
            # Pressing left will shrink the window’s width.
            # Pressing right will grow the window’s width.
            # Pressing up will shrink the window’s height.
            # Pressing down will grow the window’s height.
            bindsym $mod+h resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym $mod+j resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym $mod+k resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym $mod+l resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt
    
            # same bindings, but for the arrow keys
            bindsym Left resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym Up resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt
            bindsym Right resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt
    
            # back to normal: Enter or Escape
            bindsym Return mode "default"
            bindsym Escape mode "default"
    }

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2294/vim-and-keybinds/?answer=2295#post-id-2295</link><description>I think you have confused things here. Vim is a command-line based text editor, and i3 is a window manager. They serve different purposes.

You can use both without any problems. The usual $mod key we rely on i3 for handling the windows is normally "Window" button, which is not used in vim by default. So, if you have colliding bindings for i3 and vim, then you need to sort them out on your own. 

But if that's your case, I'd say that you are doing something wrong. I am not a VIM guru, but I use it in a regular basis and never had to use keys that collide with i3 ones... if that ever happen, you need to decide which one you will use for what purpose, and that's it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 00:52:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2294/vim-and-keybinds/?answer=2295#post-id-2295</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kratisto for &lt;p&gt;I think you have confused things here.

My point was that it would be very difficult using two different movement schemes.  </description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 22:35:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2294/vim-and-keybinds/?comment=2303#comment-2303</guid></item><item><title>Answer by syl20bnr for &lt;p&gt;Does anyone use Vim and i3?
