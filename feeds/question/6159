Title looks fine in stacked mode. The problem is that when you are tabbed most of the Window Titles won't fit it in and you see **Title...**  everywhere and you have **variable sized names** so its not going to look cool.  I think most of the modern commercial GUI's actually show the process name or icon instead of Title probably because of this.

No, this isn't possible. But there is a PR pending right now with which it would be possible when combined with a little IPC script: https://github.com/i3/i3/pull/1747 </description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 09:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6159/change-titles-in-tabbed-mode/?answer=6160#post-id-6160</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Edit: This is now possible on the current development branch and will be in the next release (probably 5.0).

I might have to compile i3 though.
