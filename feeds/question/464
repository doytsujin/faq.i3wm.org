For instance, I would like to continue working in the current program even if a new window pops up (for example a notification message for an incoming IM message). Please note, I don't want to deactivate the pop up itself, just the focus stealing.

I've never had a notification stealing focus. i3 just obeys the Xorg-flags that a new window requests, so you need to look into your notification application. Maybe it is user configurable somewhere, maybe it is a bug. 

Edit: Here are [some of the notification systems](http://faq.i3wm.org/question/121/whats-a-good-notification-daemon-for-i3/) in use by i3-users. </description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 08:02:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/464/prevent-new-windowspopups-from-stealing-focus/?answer=465#post-id-465</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to prevent new windows or pop ups from stealing focus in i3 like it is possible for KDE as described &lt;a href="http://sellingfreesoftwareforaliving.blogspot.de/2010/11/focus-stealing-settings-in-kde-and.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

1. Any X11 client (= application which connects to the X11 server) can use the `SetInputFocus` request and set focus to whereever it wants.
2. Modern X11 clients rather send a `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` ClientMessage to the window manager to make it set focus. i3 used to not implement these at all, but we do now.

So the only thing i3 can do is allow to adjust whether `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` messages are honored (currently not possible). This doesn’t solve the focus-stealing problem entirely, though.

One hackish workaround I’ve come up with is to use an X11 proxy which would filter out `SetInputFocus` calls from certain applications…</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 09:39:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/464/prevent-new-windowspopups-from-stealing-focus/?answer=471#post-id-471</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Tiddo for &lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about this before.

From which version should it be working, and does it require an option to be set? I've had problems with windows stealing focus (mostly IntelliJ) for a long time, but I still haven't found a way to prevent it.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:45:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/464/prevent-new-windowspopups-from-stealing-focus/?comment=5170#comment-5170</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Stephen for &lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about this before.
