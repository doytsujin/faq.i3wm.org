my goal was something like this:
blog.hugochinchilla.net/2013/03/using-gnome-3-with-i3-window-manager/,
setting i3 as window manager in gnome-session thus enabling the gnome-panel on top.

His setup didn't work at all, on logon i just got an error that the session couldn't be loaded. So i adapted this one:
makandracards.com/makandra/1367-running-the-awesome-window-manager-within-gnome
resulting in:

**/usr/share/xsessions/gnome-i3.desktop**&lt;br&gt;
[Desktop Entry]&lt;br&gt;
Name=GNOME with i3&lt;br&gt;
Comment=A GNOME fallback mode session using i3 as the window manager.&lt;br&gt;
TryExec=gnome-session&lt;br&gt;
Exec=gnome-session --session=i3

Name=i3&lt;br&gt;

Version=1.0&lt;br&gt;
Type=Application&lt;br&gt;
Name=i3&lt;br&gt;
TryExec=i3&lt;br&gt;
Exec=i3

the session works fine but the top gnome-panel is completely empty. I removed the tray icons from the i3status bar in the i3 config file in hope that the tray icons will show up in the gnome-panel but it didn't work.

I thought this would be the ideal setup on ubuntu for newbies and i was quite surprised that there was just one such article on the internet</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 20:15:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2527/setting-up-gnome-session-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Hibou57 for &lt;p&gt;hi,

i added the ubuntu repository referenced in http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html and updated i3. Now the tray icons work right therefore the gnome bar isn't needed anymore and i'm going to use the simple i3 session.

i'm really sorry for wasting your time.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2013 21:09:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2527/setting-up-gnome-session-i3/?comment=2538#comment-2538</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;hi,
