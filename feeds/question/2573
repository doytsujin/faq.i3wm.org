You should not use i3-nagbar for any customization, like the hibernate button you added. Please use a different solution (e.g. dmenu) for such things.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 16:09:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2573/how-to-close-nagbar-without-using-the-mouse/?answer=2575#post-id-2575</guid></item><item><title>Comment by 0xleone for &lt;p&gt;No, and that is intentional.

Is there any risk or something to use i3-nagbar to custom alerts/warnings? I made buttons to lock, logoff, suspend, save and exit, restart and shutdown. Found this way easier than a bind for each action.

Bellow my config:</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 22:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2573/how-to-close-nagbar-without-using-the-mouse/?comment=4904#comment-4904</guid></item><item><title>Comment by nivieru for &lt;p&gt;No, and that is intentional.
