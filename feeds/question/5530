Any workspace that is empty and not visible will be automatically removed because it is not needed. Just as a workspace will be automatically created if it does not yet exist when trying to go/move to it.

Unlike other window manager *i3* does not maintain a fixed list of workspaces but allows you to create any number of workspaces on the fly. This also necessitates a way to clean up workspaces. And by far the simplest solution is to just remove them automatically once they are no longer needed. If you want a workspace with the same name later on, it just can be re-created.
