What you probably want is `for _window [instance="Pidgin"] focus parent, split horizontal`</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 14:35:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/210/split-an-specific-window-horizontally/?answer=211#post-id-211</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Shahin for &lt;p&gt;That would work, but probably not do what you'd expect: it splits the container which has pidgin in it, which you would only notice by the split indicator colour on the right border, because it has no other client windows.

I have an Xchat window and pidgin window oriented vertically in a separate workspace. Now I want the pidgin chat window open horizontally after its parent! With your code all of windows orienting vertically!</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 14:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/210/split-an-specific-window-horizontally/?comment=213#comment-213</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I tried to split pidgin horizontally in a workspace with vertical orientation! but it seems it doesn't work:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/210/split-an-specific-window-horizontally/?answer=212#post-id-212</link><description>Yep, I stumbled upon that already. Unfortunately, for_window doesn’t work well with operations that modify the layout. Feel free to open a bugreport at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

Edit: Noticing that Tucos posted: The problem I noticed was specifically with "layout tabbed", I’m not sure if that’s the same problem or a different issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 14:35:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/210/split-an-specific-window-horizontally/?answer=212#post-id-212</guid></item></channel></rss>
