I would go for a terminal multiplexer like tmux in a floating window manager. If normal behavior = non-tiling, then get a non-tiling WM, especially as there is excellent tiling behavior in the exceptional application. . </description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 17:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=1990#comment-1990</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Currently using this in config:&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=1992#comment-1992</link><description>lol hehe, welcome aboard :) But just choose the best tool for the job. You could always run i3 on a different TTY than openbox, and juggle with Xvfb and Xephyr to swap applications from the one to the other. Did not reach stability with that aproach, though :)</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 20:21:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=1992#comment-1992</guid></item><item><title>Answer by badboy_ for &lt;p&gt;Currently using this in config:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?answer=1984#post-id-1984</link><description>Just add another for_window line above which matches the terminal and set `floating disable`. 

Keep in mind that i3 is a tiling window manager. Maybe i3 is not the best solution for your workflow then.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 08:00:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?answer=1984#post-id-1984</guid></item><item><title>Comment by MeanEYE for &lt;p&gt;Just add another for_window line above which matches the terminal and set &lt;code&gt;floating disable&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=2032#comment-2032</link><description>i3 is not built around idea that all windows are floated. If tiling is not your cup of tea, you should try something else. If you ask me, tiling window managers are wort the troubles during adaptation period.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 15:49:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=2032#comment-2032</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Mr Green for &lt;p&gt;Just add another for_window line above which matches the terminal and set &lt;code&gt;floating disable&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

From what I have read the first thing users do is set up floating windows for gui applications. my thinking was to work the other way around. Will try adding an exception as per you answer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 08:46:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?comment=1985#comment-1985</guid></item><item><title>Answer by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;Currently using this in config:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1983/all-floating-windows-except-terminal/?answer=1994#post-id-1994</link><description>I used to use terminator before moving to i3... if you only need tiling for terminals, that's a very good option.
