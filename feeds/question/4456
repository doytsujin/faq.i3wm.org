    i3 -v

    i3status -v</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 06:09:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4456/i3bar-error-status_command-not-found-exit-127/?answer=4461#post-id-4461</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jatcheson for &lt;p&gt;What version of i3, i3status respectively are you using?
