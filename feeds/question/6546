I'm working since 2 months with i3 and I'm really happy so far. Only one thing / issue left to resolve for me ...

I'm a programmer and do stuff for Android as well. Therefore I'm useing the "Android Studio" which is based on IntelliJ. Android Studio comes with an built-in emulator to test Apps. The emulators pops up when I click on "run" and /or "debuging". The emulator window is very small in width and normally I would be able to move this window aside to the Android Studio so that I can still see my code but on i3 it pops up right in the middle of the screen which means I can't read my code while debuging.

Normally I would go into my i3 config file and set the emulator window floating with "title" or "class" option but this time I don't know the title of the window, because it's not shown in the top bar of i3 (window list).

Is there any other way to determine the name / class of this window? Could I go with a "ps" output?

Best regards

Anyway, I figured out, that the window top frame was out of the visible area of the screen. Therefore I hold down the meta key + clicked and hold with the mouse within the emulator window. With this action I was able to move the window around and I found out, that the window is already floating ... but good to know what do next time if this happens again ;)</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 12:15:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6546/how-to-make-a-window-floating-without-a-visible-name/?answer=6551#post-id-6551</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oberon for &lt;p&gt;Hello everbody,&lt;/p&gt;
