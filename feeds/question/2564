 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?answer=2565#post-id-2565</link><description>You mean ``dmenu_run``, I suppose? Start ``dmenu_run`` from the command line, and see if there is some error. 

One possibility is that the cache file that ``dmenu_run`` uses internally, somehow has not updated itself to include this application. If so, deleting the cache file will cause it to be regenerated. Look at ``less $(which dmenu_run)`` to find the location of this cache file. 

If not, check if the binary is in $PATH as dmenu_run sees it.

In my version that would be `| ${SHELL:-/bin/sh} &gt;tmp/dmenu_log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;`. Maybe write a line in dmenu_run to the effect of `env &gt;&gt; tmp/dmenu_env`, as I suspect the error to be in the environment not completely set. </description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 19:43:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?comment=2630#comment-2630</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;You mean &lt;code&gt;dmenu_run&lt;/code&gt;, I suppose?

Deleting the cahce doesn't help anything. But if i run the dmenu_run from terminal and then tries to open matlab from the dmenu_run it works like a charm. 

Does change anything that I had to create a symbolic link for maltab?</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 12:24:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?comment=2625#comment-2625</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;You mean &lt;code&gt;dmenu_run&lt;/code&gt;, I suppose?

But i found a solution for the problem.
In /usr/bin make a script named matlab that contains this:

    !#/bin/bash
    /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014a/bin/matlab -desktop`

make it executables:
    `chmod a+x matlab`

not you should be able to run matlab from dmenu</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 13:56:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?answer=3765#post-id-3765</guid></item><item><title>Answer by adder for &lt;p&gt;Hi

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?answer=3143#post-id-3143</link><description>I have issues with matlab and dmenu too. I could not launch matlab from dmenu. I partially solved the issue by putting an one-line shell script in my PATH with the line: /path/to/matlab -desktop.
Now, the strange thing:
If I have a window open (like an xterm) in the current workspace, then launching the above script with dmenu starts up matlab fine (albeit, in half the screen). Then I can move the matlab to a new workspace on its own.
But, if I launch the above script on an empty workspace, matlab doesn't start properly and I only get a grey window.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 17:40:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2564/cant-open-matlab-from-dmenu/?answer=3143#post-id-3143</guid></item></channel></rss>
