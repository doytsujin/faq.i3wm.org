I'm thinking about the right mode to use for some windows which don't fit as tiling windows. My current workaround is to make them floating, but since I read that tiling is only for popup windows (faq.i3wm.org/question/772/floating-workspace/?answer=773#post-id-773), I'm not sure any more, if it is the correct way of handling these windows.

The best example for such a window is QEMU. In tiling or fullscreen mode, the text just looks ugly and is in some cases even unreadable.

What do you recommend?</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 08:47:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1713/recommended-mode-for-windows-that-are-not-suitable-for-tiling/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

That way, it will (nearly) be full-screened, and it’d be odd if an application such as qemu would not cope with full-screened windows, right?

The other alternative is to either use a different app in the first place or report an upstream bug.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 08:59:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1713/recommended-mode-for-windows-that-are-not-suitable-for-tiling/?answer=1714#post-id-1714</guid></item><item><title>Comment by iiiuser for &lt;p&gt;One alternative to using floating mode is often to place the window on its own workspace.

With some screen resolutions it may work, with others it may not. Since I don't like VirtualBox and this issue rather seems to be intended behaviour than a bug, I will have to stick to using the floating mode.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 18:57:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1713/recommended-mode-for-windows-that-are-not-suitable-for-tiling/?comment=1720#comment-1720</guid></item></channel></rss>
