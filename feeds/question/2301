After a system upgrade, I noticed that I can no longer see Qt menus while using i3 (would love to post an image or link but I can't). This also happens with context menus and combo boxes. It's definitely specific to i3 as this doesn't happen with any of the other WMs I've tried (fluxbox, mutter, subtle). I've tried deleting my Qt config but it had no effect.

The strangest thing is that it doesn't happen with Clementine 1.1.1, which also uses Qt 4.8.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:56:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2301/qt-menus-not-showing/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I'm using i3 4.5.1 on Arch 3.10.2 with Qt 4.8.5.&lt;/p&gt;
