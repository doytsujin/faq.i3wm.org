I have a following problem. When I close a last window, i3 doesn't refresh a screen and the window's image stays in a screen.

Which driver are you using? Try vesa to verify that your current driver causes it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 18:32:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2007/i3-doesnt-refresh-a-screen-after-window-closing/?comment=2011#comment-2011</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mhd for &lt;p&gt;Hi, all.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem was fixed after these steps. If vesa driver is installed on my machine then i3 refreshes a screen. Should I use vesa driver instead of intel driver if I want to use i3? </description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 09:33:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2007/i3-doesnt-refresh-a-screen-after-window-closing/?comment=2021#comment-2021</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mhd for &lt;p&gt;Hi, all.&lt;/p&gt;

I installed SLiM, disabled GDM, enabled SLiM in systemd and i3 refreshes a screen now. Perhaps GDM affects the refreshing of i3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 10:40:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2007/i3-doesnt-refresh-a-screen-after-window-closing/?answer=2030#post-id-2030</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I used GDM.

I suppose the problem is somewhere else, but I donâ€™t really have any clue what it could be, sorry.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 21:44:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2007/i3-doesnt-refresh-a-screen-after-window-closing/?comment=2035#comment-2035</guid></item></channel></rss>
