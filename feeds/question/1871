I am no expert at Regex as well.
It seems, that **(?!something)** would match, if **something** is not found.

It does not work for me yet.&lt;br/&gt;
To me it's still unclear if this regex would work, if it is supported in i3 and if the syntax in my conf file is correct.

For now I have it like this:
for_window [class="Ddd" instance="tool"] floating enabled

This of course does not work for the splash screen, but the most important thing is, that the tool window is floating.

If anybody can enlighten me, I would be very happy. But I can live with this solution. (Still bugs me a little to not have the perfect solution, though)
