My problem is synapse always shows on workspace 1, no matter where I launch it.
On my second PC at home, wich is a less clean install of:
Ubuntu 12.04 -&gt; remove unity, i3, synapse
it works as intended.
My dot files are synced through github/dropbox, so both .i3/config and the synapse config are exactly the same.

Any idea why this might be happening?</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:57:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1450/launcher-always-appears-on-workspace-1/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Xananax for &lt;p&gt;I am using arch, i3 &amp;amp; synapse (a launcher, sorta like dmenu but better looking).&lt;/p&gt;
