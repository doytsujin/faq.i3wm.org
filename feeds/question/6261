I am using Ubuntu 14.04 i3 and I am trying to edit my i3 config file located in /etc/i3/config. I tried to edit the file using
gedit config. I am able to open the config file using gedit but the option to save my changes is greyed out. I checked the permissions of the config file and noticed the following:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6148 May  4 04:17 config&lt;br&gt;
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5290 May  4 04:17 config.keycodes

I have no clue why the file is read only when it seems like I am logged in as root? The permissions show that I have write access so I'm not quite sure why I can't edit the file, maybe I'm reading the permissions wrong?

I'm not sure if this is related or not but I'm also confused as to why it shows root as the user? When I start up my machine I get to choose if I want to log in using the Unity file manager or i3. Any thoughts or help would be much appreciated.

"root" in your output shows the user and group ownership of the file. As it is the system wide configuration in /etc, it belonging to root is correct.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 15:02:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6261/config-file-is-read-only/?comment=6263#comment-6263</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mechpro for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
