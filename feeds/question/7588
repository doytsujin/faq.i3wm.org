I'm a heavy keyboard user and I notice that a lot of tools (emacs, vim, ratpoison) seem to cope well with me making a LOT of mistakes. By mistakes I mean: typing (as in code or e-mails etc) while in the wrong mode, or sending key combinations for which there is no binding in my *rc.

I'll give a couple of examples so that it make more sense:

 - emacs - I type `C-x C-nonsense` and get a friendly error
 - emacs - I type `C-x blah` accidently and spam `C-g` until any random command or mode I just oppened goes away.
 - ratpoison - I type `C-r` (or whatevere the ratpoison prefix is) and instantly all further keypresses are interpreted as ratpoison commands.
 - tmux - same as ratpoison.

So my problem is that with i3 - there isn't really a 'prefix' key like in tmux and ratpoison and emacs (I don't use vim very often). I simulated the idea of a prefix by creating a 'wm' mode in i3.
However, while in this mode, any keypresses are passed on to the window in focus unless they are overridden with `bindsym`. So my question:

**Is there a way to prevent ALL keypresses EXCEPT those overridden with `bindsym` from being passed to the window in focus? At least just for a particular mode? How can I acheieve this?**

That way I can have a prefix style operation rather than a vim-like operation (nothing wrong with vim - but since I'm so used to emacs I keep hitting `C-x` by accident and end up in some crazy mode).

I guess my real problem is that I need to think before I type - but that ain't gonna happen any time soon.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 20:13:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7588/keybinding/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by i3convert for &lt;p&gt;This may sound odd but here we go.

Unfortunately, there is no way to specify the default behavior (of unassigned keys) as far as I'm aware, but this could be a great feature request in my opinion.

One currently possible solution would be to write a script for generating your config file. It would add the empty command ( `nop` ) for unspecified keys. This shouldn't be too hard, at least when it comes to covering the most popular keys.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 04:26:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7588/keybinding/?answer=7599#post-id-7599</guid></item></channel></rss>
