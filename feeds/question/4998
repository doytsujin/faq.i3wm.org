After I changed the font, I've been noticing the font size will be huge when I login with i3.  We're talking at least twice as tall.  

I figured out restarting i3 seems to fix it.  However, this also seems to change the behavior of gnome-settings-daemon slightly (which I use for small little conveniences--nothing major), and I feel like I shouldn't have to restart the WM to have properly sized font.

I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this issue, or if they know how I might fix it?  (note:  the default font does not suffer this issue).  the font lines from my config (one or the other would always be commented out):

    font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
    font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10
