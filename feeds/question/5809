I usually use the "tabbed" mode `mod+w`. When I open mplayer, it occupies the entire screen which leaves some black space on either side for most videos. To avoid this problem I made it floating and plan to move it to another workspace if I really need to keep it on. 

In general I think apps like mplayer looks awkward when opened in "tabbed mode" and they are not suited for tiling as they have their own optimal window size decided by the application. All such programs are usually better off in the floating mode?

First is default , Second is floating, Third is noaspectratio.

Currently I use this:

`for_window [class="MPlayer"] floating enable`
