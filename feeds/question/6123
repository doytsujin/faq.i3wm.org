In particular Section 2.8 discusses the topic of resizing windows. You can use the mouse or keyboard.

If you care about getting **exactly** the 2:1 split, then one option that should work is to save your current layout and modify the `"percent"` field, before reloading it. See the [document on saving layouts](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) for more details.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2015 21:24:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6123/make-window-take-twice-as-much-space/?answer=6125#post-id-6125</guid></item><item><title>Comment by i3convert for &lt;p&gt;If you just want to resize windows, then issues like this are excellently covered in &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html"&gt;i3 User's Guide&lt;/a&gt;.

I assumed he didn't care about getting exactly the 2:1 split. He could probably use layouts (http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) for that, and modify the `percent` parameter. Let me edit my answer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 14:54:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6123/make-window-take-twice-as-much-space/?comment=6134#comment-6134</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;If you just want to resize windows, then issues like this are excellently covered in &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html"&gt;i3 User's Guide&lt;/a&gt;.

The closest you can get without scripting is `resize grow width 0 px or 17 ppt`, but it will still be slightly off. Might be good enough, though.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2015 08:32:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6123/make-window-take-twice-as-much-space/?comment=6129#comment-6129</guid></item></channel></rss>
