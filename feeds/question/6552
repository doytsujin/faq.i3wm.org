Would it be possible to show a tooltip of the full string to allow for cases where it is truncated (eg. in tabbed mode)?

The long title is often useful (eg. full filepath)  and I don't think it can always be sensibly shortened with 'title_format'.  For some applications there may be no other way of determining the path of the currently open file.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6552/tooltips-for-window-titles/?answer=6553#post-id-6553</link><description>You could write a small script `~/.config/i3/title_popup.sh` like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    notify-send "$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowname)"

Note that you need some notification daemon for this (e.g., dunst). Then, use a keybinding (or any binding) like this:

    # middle mouse button on window title triggers notification
    bindsym button2 exec --no-startup-id $HOME/.config/i3/title_popup.sh

Unfortunately i3 has no "hover" feature. So if it has to be hovering, you'll need to write a tool (or see if something exists).
