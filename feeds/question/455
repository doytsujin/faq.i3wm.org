is there a convenient way for having two containers with separate layout modes side by side?
For example, how do I create two horizontal split containers both in a tabbed layout easily (see below)?

    | progr 1/2 cont. | progr 3/4 cont. |
    |_________________|_________________|

Right now, I create something like this in the following way:

    1. Start program 1
    2. Switch to tabbed mode (mod+w)
    3. Start program 2
    4. Select the parent container (mod+a)
    5. Start program 3
    6. Switch to tabbed mode (mod+w) -&gt; now, the parent container of 
         program 1/2 is on tab next to  program 3
    7. Select the parent container of program 1 and 2 (mod+a) and move 
         it away from program 3 (mod+shift+arrowKey)
    8. Select program 3 and start program 4

Although this approach is working fine for me, it looks a bit tedious to perform all 8 steps described above for such a useful layout-arrangement. 

Is there a more convenient way than the one I described above? Is it maybe possible to change the layout of a container separately?

Thank you very much!</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 16:15:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/455/creating-two-containers-with-separate-layout-modes-side-by-side/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

    1. Open program 1
    2. Open program 3
    3. Make vertical split
    4. Open program 4
    5. Make tabbed layout
    6. Focus program 1
    7. split vertical
    8. Open program 2
    9. Press $mod+w

Just as long as your method (as you are cheeting a bit in step 7 :P )
An alternative route for your suggestion, that actually is one step shorter: 

    6. Vertical split
    7. Open program 4
    8. Make container tabbed

But then again, counting key presses is not my strongest point :) </description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 16:42:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/455/creating-two-containers-with-separate-layout-modes-side-by-side/?answer=456#post-id-456</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Richard for &lt;p&gt;This is what I would do without thinking: &lt;/p&gt;

I am now using a solution I like better than the two described above: Defining a shortcut for "i3-msg split v &amp;&amp; i3-msg layout tabbed" in the i3 config allows turning a selected container directly into the tabbed layout. It merges splitting and tabbing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 18:28:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/455/creating-two-containers-with-separate-layout-modes-side-by-side/?comment=1583#comment-1583</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Richard for &lt;p&gt;This is what I would do without thinking: &lt;/p&gt;

I like your first option more than my own one. It just looks more straight forward :-)</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 17:02:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/455/creating-two-containers-with-separate-layout-modes-side-by-side/?comment=457#comment-457</guid></item></channel></rss>
