It and should not be affected by i3 (unless you specifically bind `Ctrl+a` in your i3 configuration). Does it work if you use other WMs? Which applications?</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 07:43:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4735/ctrl-a-doesnt-work/?comment=4741#comment-4741</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I use ubuntu 14.04

You’re not entirely clear in your question about whether you are using the default config and your _only_ change is the modifier. If so, look elsewhere for programs that could interfere with Ctrl+a (terminate running processes one by one and see when it starts working). If not, try the default config.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 07:39:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4735/ctrl-a-doesnt-work/?answer=4738#post-id-4738</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Deus Deceit for &lt;p&gt;i3 doesn’t grab Ctrl+a.

I'm sorry to post a question before checking everything first. I'm just so new with i3 and so old with firefox that it had to be i3 (since ctrl +a) worked all this time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 20:58:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4735/ctrl-a-doesnt-work/?comment=4760#comment-4760</guid></item></channel></rss>
