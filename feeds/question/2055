Well. Maybe I got carried away when I wrote "Thanks in advance for _any_ answer".
One cannot simply(TM) type "sudo reboot" once the machine is unresponsive, let alone switch to a workspace with an open terminal.
As is explained quite nicely in the quoted wikipdia article, holding SysRq and typing the aforementioned sequence of keys is kind of a last resort to regain control over your machine when the beast won't do anything anymore.

Maybe it's not i3's fault. Maybe the kernel got into a condition, from which nothing could be done anyway. I'll try to explain the details: I was listening to some music with XBMC on HDMI1, while at the same time changing some Firefox preferences on LVDS1. I put the preference dialog into floating mode and started changing. Once I tried to save the new settings, the floating window became unresponsive _and_ a very small portion of the track I was listening to started to loop. So a was sitting there with a pseudo-techno loop and an unresponsive screen. I tried SysRq R E I S U B -- but I had to hard-reset my machine. That's about it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 07:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2055/sysrq-r-e-i-s-u-b-is-not-working/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I installed i3 a few months ago under ubuntu 12.10 with gnome shell.

Have you tried:

    sudo reboot

I never worried about SysRq because:

  - I run on a Apple hardware (they don't have this key);
  - Laptop nowadays you never need to shutdown, just suspend by lid action;
  - and lastly, I rarely have a window without a terminal on it, so typing reboot is not much of a pain to me, when I need it. </description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 22:33:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2055/sysrq-r-e-i-s-u-b-is-not-working/?answer=2060#post-id-2060</guid></item></channel></rss>
