I found that i3-msg can also be used. 

For e.g. while in an xterm window the following two commands do the same thing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
$ i3 border none
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
$ i3-msg border none
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would like to know if there is a difference between the two approaches.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 11:46:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2411/i3-msg-vs-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by badboy_ for &lt;p&gt;Using i3 for sending commands to current i3 instance works.

As you will see when using `i3 border none` the output includes `Additional arguments passed. Sending them as a command to i3`, which is exactly the same i3-msg does. i3-msg was the original client that came with i3 (and still is), the main binary was later switched to also send commands</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 13:55:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2411/i3-msg-vs-i3/?answer=2413#post-id-2413</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;It's effectively the same.
