    [marcos ~/.i3]$ xrandr

       640x480        59.9     59.9  

With this configuration I can move between windows on both displays with focus left/right. However, I would like to change the settings to have the VGA-0 display sit at the bottom of the virtual space and not the top.
After I issue a:

    [marcos ~/.i3]$ xrandr --output VGA-0 --auto --pos 1920x30

The outputs are exactly like I want them, but now I can't switch windows with focus left/right.

Any workaround or explanation?</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2012 17:04:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/495/focus-leftright-with-fixed-outputs/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Here's the output from my xrandr:&lt;/p&gt;
