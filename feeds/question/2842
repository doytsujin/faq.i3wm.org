Long answer: There is no such feature, yet. You could post a feature request on the bug tracker or even write a patch yourself. I'm not sure about the chances of this getting into mainline i3. I guess it will depend on the added complexity (impact on current code, configuration, code maintenance, testing), if Michael gives the ok. </description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2013 07:16:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2842/how-can-i-display-an-applications-titlebar-on-the-bottom/?answer=2844#post-id-2844</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Alice for &lt;p&gt;Short answer: There is no such feature. &lt;/p&gt;
