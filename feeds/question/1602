&gt; assign class="^Firefox$"] 9

If I open Firefox it goes to workspace 9 as expected. However, if I try to save a file (right-clicking a link and selecting "Save as") the window opened goes to another  workspace labeled as 9 too.                                                             

When this occurs I can see two workspaces with the exact same label (9 is this case). Also, when I press "meta + 9" the focus goes to the second created workspace 9.

Is this a bug?

I'm using the last version:
