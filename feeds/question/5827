I have been looking around on your site and others The option absolute middle does not apply on a dual screen but could work if I can say to take the middle of the second screen.

Or if I can tell it to go to the second screen to the top right. That's were I would like it to be with the normal dimension of the program.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 08:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5827/how-to-position-a-floating-window-on-a-dual-screen-to-the-top-right/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Spotify has some kind of problem when opening in full screen.
