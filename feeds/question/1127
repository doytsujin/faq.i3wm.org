I'm playing with gnome-pie as I want to use it when I'm lazy and don't want to reach for the keyboard :). The main problem is that when pie is run the focus shifts to the new floating window. This is solvable, I just switch back focus with focus toggle_mode and it works. 
But it works for non floating windows. Is there some focus previous command that I can use instead.

I think that using mouse or touch is a very interesting way to interact with a window manager like i3 and that it might open door to new opportunities. Since the 'near' future is in laptop/tablet transformers, having usable and easy interface in each mode is a very big plus. And this is pretty easy to do with 3rd party software like gnome-pie.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1127/focus-previous-window/?comment=1135#comment-1135</link><description>I need to revert the focus to the previous  window for the command to work. And I cant use mode_toggle if the window is already in the floating mode. But I'm very happy with the way gnome-pie works with i3. I have total control of my i3 with a mouse or touch pad, it's very cool.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2013 12:17:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1127/focus-previous-window/?comment=1135#comment-1135</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1127/focus-previous-window/?answer=1190#post-id-1190</link><description>So, as far as I interpret your question, you are trying to use multiple floating windows, one of them is gnome-pie, and then want to programmatically revert focus to the floating window where it was before gnome-pie was started.

It seems to me that just using `focus left` should do precisely that.

Note that i3 does not encourage using more than one floating window at a time. Floating windows are for passphrase dialogs and the like, not for real work.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 07:19:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1127/focus-previous-window/?answer=1190#post-id-1190</guid></item></channel></rss>
