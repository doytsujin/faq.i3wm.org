I'd like to give i3 a try, but have the choice to go back and forth between my existing setup and i3.  Can I do this? How? How do I switch back and forth?

To clarify:
1. Currently, I don't get any choice of WM - it just takes me right into LXDE

2. Can I do this without rebooting?

3. Can I do this without closing all my open applications? Will they be available under both sessions? How?

4. Can I run i3 on one virtual display and my current WM on another? How?</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2013 19:03:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2348/can-i-install-i3-without-replacing-my-existing-setup/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Tohwi for &lt;p&gt;I'm running Ubuntu 11 and LXDE.

Just install the i3 package, and you will be able to select between i3 and the other installed windows manager in your session manager (at startup, or when you close your session).

Edit: Answers to new questions

1. All you need to do is close your session, not reboot
2. I don't think so. That might be possible, but I never tried launching two X sessions at once. In any way, I really doubt you would be able to access your GUI applications with both windows managers at the same time.
3. I don't think so. You'd better use another computer or a virtual machine to do so.
Edit: actually you can with xorg-server-xephyr, see comment below</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2013 20:35:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2348/can-i-install-i3-without-replacing-my-existing-setup/?answer=2349#post-id-2349</guid></item><item><title>Comment by srobertjames for &lt;p&gt;Of course!
