After the dialogue and confirmation, what really exits the i3 session and gets you back into your X login manager, is the command `i3-msg exit`. 

So, to test, execute `i3-msg exit` in a terminal, and see if it works. If it doesn't, and there are no hints in the terminal what blocks this command to execute successfully, or in your systems logs. At any case, file a bug at Ubuntu, as there apparently is an oversight in the packaging. </description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 07:52:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3342/modshifte-yields-please-do-not-run-this-program-on-ubuntu/?answer=3346#post-id-3346</guid></item></channel></rss>
