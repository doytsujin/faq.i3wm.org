Now moved to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and installed i3 4.1.2. I use a software that works perfectly in i3 3.d-bf1-1. However in i3 4.1.2 the help window (activated by F1 key) of this program comes up without any window decorations. It sits on top of the other tiled windows blocking them. When I click on the help window, I get the following message in the terminal:

ERROR: Clicked into unknown window ?!

However if I open the help window first in Gnome and then replace metacity with i3, the window works fine.

i3 is absolutely essential for me. I can't think of using any other wm. This issue is keeping me from upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04. Any help in fixing this issue will be much appreciated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2012 03:56:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/398/error-clicked-into-unknown-window/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by i3er for &lt;p&gt;I've been using i3 for a long time in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

The symptom you are having is that the window you are talking about is not managed by i3. To debug this, please upgrade to the latest git version (see http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html), enable logging (see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html), reproduce the issue and then file a ticket at http://bugs.i3wm.org/ with steps to reproduce and a full debug-loglevel logfile.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2012 08:13:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/398/error-clicked-into-unknown-window/?answer=399#post-id-399</guid></item></channel></rss>
