Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Edit: Please note that goal here is not eye candy. It can be very convenient to be able to see through floating windows in a cluttered and small screen to see the content of the tiled layer. Admittedly the purpose of a tiling window manager is to avoid window overlap, but there are always popup windows and the occasional "legitimate" use of floating windows.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 19:17:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/826/true-transparency-in-floating-windows/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by kursion for &lt;p&gt;Since i3 always places floating windows on top of tiled windows, it would be very useful to be able to render floating windows transparent.

I'm using Xcompmgr with transset-df !!! And guess what it works !!!
Btw a fork called Compton is better can can be install from the AUR of linux

sudo yaourt -S compton-git
(don't forget to install transset-df, it's very usefull)

I love it: shadows and true transparency is working very well !!!

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/826/true-transparency-in-floating-windows/?comment=834#comment-834</link><description>It is accurate. i3 does not support it.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/826/true-transparency-in-floating-windows/?answer=5372#post-id-5372</link><description>If i3 does not support transparency it does not support transparency. The use of third party compositing libraries should explicitly indicate the fact. i3 simply manages screen real estate letting xorg or whatever desktop manager the user has running deal with layout and composition per the application. The way i3 manages everything maintains a really small foot-print and provides a credible amount of versatility.

Compton is actually managing the transparency and/or making the necessary desktop manager calls. i3 will not accidentally offer transparency as a service due to a bug. i3 could however, one day, add an option to interface with other desktop managers present on the users system concerning composition, but that will require time if it happens and a great deal of beta testing.

Third party plugins like that Compton transparency manager sound like the way to go with i3. Keeps everything light weight, modular and survivable where a module crashes it does not affect i3 or any other stable module.

I smell a community plugins opportunity if there isn't already one floating about.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 14:22:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/826/true-transparency-in-floating-windows/?answer=5372#post-id-5372</guid></item></channel></rss>
