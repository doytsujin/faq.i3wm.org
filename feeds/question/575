Seems good enough I want to use it on my computer at work. One question though before I switch.

In dwm, most of the time I assign one tag to each window, meaning I'm using the tag system like workspaces in i3. Sometimes I do have multiple tags for a window, and I'm wondering if that can be done in i3. Essentially what I want is have a window show up in multiple workspaces. Is that possible?</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 21:43:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/575/dwm-like-tagging/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi there, just installed i3 on my laptop to try it out.

How would sticky window would defer from giving multiple tags to a window? I guess if you used a different word, that means this will be different in some way.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:47:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/575/dwm-like-tagging/?comment=1557#comment-1557</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;No, this is not possible yet (as of i3 v4.3).&lt;/p&gt;
