I am not sure how I can assign a keyboard shortcut. Other than shutter, I don't know of anything comparable. Post-editing screenshots in Picasa just grew too annoying.

EDIT have to retract above. Shutter only works with Selection.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 14:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/202/what-do-you-guys-use-for-printscreen/?comment=207#comment-207</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;I am running Linux on a Mac (forgive me, lol), and I am horrified with the fact my notebook does not have a printscreen button, then I have to bind it with some nasty key I hardly remember which one is. &lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/202/what-do-you-guys-use-for-printscreen/?answer=301#post-id-301</link><description>I have a script which takes a screenshot using import from imagemagick. It's able to shot whole root window or currently focused window. That depends on the only one argument
it takes.

    screen.sh root
    screen.sh active

At the top of the script there are to variables which control its behaviour.  The SCREEN\_DIR is a directory where you want to save your screenshots. And the SCREEN\_PROMPT defines whether you want to be prompted for name of screenshot by i3-input. If you don't then this variable must not be set at all. 

You can export these variables from your startup scripts to have settings separated from script itself.

The screenshot is saved in SCREEN\_DIR under name in format NAME-YEAR-MONTH-DAY_HOUR-MIN-SEC.png where NAME is string typed in to the i3-input. If prompt is disabled or empty string is given then WM\_CLASS of window is used or just "window" if WM\_CLASS is not set. In case of root window screenshot NAME is "root".

And finally symlink named 'last' pointing to last taken screenshot is created for easier lookup.


    #!/bin/bash

    SCREEN_PROMPT=1
    
    window='root'
    
    case $1 in

    esac
    
    [ ! -z "$SCREEN_PROMPT" ] &amp;&amp; \
      name=`i3-input -P 'screen-name: ' | sed -n '/command = /s/command = //p'`
    
    if [ -z "$name" ];then
      if [ $window == "root" ];then
        name='root'
      else
        name=`xprop -id $window | sed -n '/WM_CLASS/s/.* = "\([^\"]*\)".*/\1\n/p'`
        [ -z "$name" ] &amp;&amp; name='window'

    import -border -window $window "$SCREEN_DIR/$filename"
    

    ln -sf "$filename" $SCREEN_DIR/last
    
    exit

In i3 config just create simple binding.

    bindsym Print exec screen.sh root
    bindsym Mod1+Print exec screen.sh active

Note that if you take second screenshot during single second the previous one taken in that same second gets overwritten since there is no check for this case. So if you like to use printscreen to make movies you should check for this.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/202/what-do-you-guys-use-for-printscreen/?answer=6538#post-id-6538</link><description>I like `scrot`, because it's simple, and it can do everything I need (bindings of my configuration):

 - fullscreen screenshoot (PrnScr)
 - window screenshoot(Alt + PrnScr)
 - select windows screenshoot(Alt + Shift + PrnScr)

Combined with `date` command it can create screens with timestamp in filename, which can be edited later.

Here is the config:

    bindsym Print exec scrot $HOME/Pictures/ScreenShoots/`date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S`.png
    bindsym Mod1+Print exec scrot -u $HOME/Pictures/ScreenShoots/`date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S`.png
    bindsym Mod1+Shift+Print exec scrot -s $HOME/Pictures/ScreenShoots/`date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S`.png

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/202/what-do-you-guys-use-for-printscreen/?answer=4682#post-id-4682</link><description>I use a mix of scrot and python to load directly the screen capture into clipboard.

In my config I got 

    bindsym Print exec scrot -e 'pyclip $f'
    bindsym Mod1+Print exec scrot -s -e 'pyclip $f'

and got this small python script to load it into clipboard that I took from [superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/301851/how-to-copy-a-picture-to-clipboard-from-command-line-in-linux)
The trick is that your program need to stay active as long as the clipboard contains the image.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import gtk 
    import sys
    
    count = 0
    def handle_owner_change(clipboard, event):
        global count
        print 'clipboard.owner-change(%r, %r)' % (clipboard, event)
        count += 1
        # On my new computer, I had to push counter to 2 because the event is triggered immediatly and script goes out with the buffer. This version keeps the buffer until next screenshot.
        if count &gt; 2:
           sys.exit(0)
    
    image = gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file(sys.argv[1])
    clipboard = gtk.clipboard_get()
    clipboard.connect('owner-change', handle_owner_change)
    clipboard.set_image(image)
    clipboard.store()
    gtk.main()

Work out of box and it is the best.

It has a **delay** feature. It can delay several seconds before taking snapshot. This feature is really useful when you need take screen shot of some menus or tooltip.

I don't see any other tool supporting this feature. 

I don't understand why so many people here use script and command line tool to take screenshot. What is the merit? Flexible? Configurable? But what you do by your scripts is the same with what I do by ksnapshot

It is unmaintained but works (for my applications). It has some &lt;a href="http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/scrot"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;strong&gt;-s&lt;/strong&gt; to interactively select a window/rectangle, or &lt;strong&gt;-d&lt;/strong&gt; for a delay and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that problem, I was wondering what do you use to capture a screenshot with i3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am huge fan of &lt;a href="http://shutter-project.org/"&gt;shutter&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not work in i3 well (only selection works, the rest complains of "Keyboard could not be grabbed", which looks like a problem because of the mac keyboard, I'd guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard in the mailing list about KScreenshot, and others go deeper with xwd... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your best choice for i3?&lt;/p&gt;

A little while ago I used `gnome-screenshot`, but it recently stop working on my system, maybe because of a dist update, or an i3 update, I'm not sure.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/202/what-do-you-guys-use-for-printscreen/?answer=5752#post-id-5752</link><description>Similar solution than lobik using perl with 4 options:

    bindsym $mod+Print exec Print_Screen root 
    bindsym --release $mod+Shift+Print exec Print_Screen area
    bindsym $mod+Mod1+Print exec Print_Screen delay
    bindsym $mod+Control+Print exec Print_Screen window

This is the script, sending a message when the screenshot is taken. 

    #!/usr/bin/env perl 
    # Info {{{
    #  DESCRIPTION: Print Screen
    # }}}
    
    # use {{{
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use experimental 'smartmatch';
    use v5.20;
    # }}}
    
    # Variables {{{
    my @print_option = qw/root area window delay sequence/;
    my $timestamp = `date +%Y_%m-%d_%H-%M`; 
    chomp $timestamp;
    my $target = "/home/mimosinnet/Dades/Imatges/ScreenShots/$timestamp.png";
    my (@args, $window);
    
    die "Usage: \n Print_Screen root|area|window|delay \n" unless 
    	(scalar @ARGV == 1) and ($ARGV[0] ~~ @print_option);
    
    # }}}
    
    # Select options {{{
    for ( $ARGV[0] ) {
    	if ( /root/   ) 
    		{	@args = ("import", "-window", "root", $target) }
    	if ( /area/   ) 
    		{	@args = ("import", $target) }
    	if ( /window/ )
    		{ 	$window = `xprop -root | grep "_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)"`;
    			($window) = $window =~ /(0.*$)/ ;
    			@args = ("import", "-window", $window, $target) } 
    	if ( /delay/  )
    		{	sleep 5;
    			$window = `xprop -root | grep "_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)"`;
    			($window) = $window =~ /(0.*$)/ ;
    			@args = ("import", "-window", $window, $target) } 
    };
    # }}}
    
    # Debugging
    # foreach (@args) { print "$_ "; } exit;
    
    system(@args) == 0 or die "unable to do the screenshot because of: $?";
    
    @args = ("xmessage", "-nearmouse", "Captura de Pantalla Feta");
    system(@args) == 0 or die "unable to show message because of: $?";
