I've been configuring my first i3 install over the past few days, and it's doing pretty well. However, any video that I attempt to play loads up and then just sits. If I go to youtube (chrome), I get the first frame, I can see the buffer indicator run out about one third, and if I click through the video I can go to other frames and they display fine, but do not play. Similar experience with mplayer, though when I skip through I'm pretty sure there's a little bit of movement, just a blink (maybe 100 milliseconds). 

Weird part is when I try in firefox I get about 10 seconds of movement, no audio (audio works fine from non-video sources btw), then it freezes again. Jump around the video some, plays more then stops again.

Works fine if I log out and go to gnome-shell, or if I try to play video within a Windows VM running in i3.

I will continue banging my head on this thing and report back.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 16:05:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4434/all-video-stuck-paused/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Phekka for &lt;p&gt;Greetings i3, having trouble with my google-fu, decided to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

With the VM off everything works fine. Consistent return to frozen videos if I start the VM again. </description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2014 00:53:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4434/all-video-stuck-paused/?comment=4526#comment-4526</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;Greetings i3, having trouble with my google-fu, decided to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a fork of mplayer2 and actively developed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 10:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4434/all-video-stuck-paused/?comment=4439#comment-4439</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;Greetings i3, having trouble with my google-fu, decided to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
