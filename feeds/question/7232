 - lxsession

 - sugar-session
 - mate-session-manager
 - openbox
 - gnome-session-flashback
 - gnome-session
 - xfce4-session

Am I correct to say that neither of this session-managers is required to run and use i3wm? (At least I don't see one running on my system)
Would it make sense to add a i3wm-session, in order to attract people to i3wm and support an ease of use approach for new users?</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 10:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7232/debian-x-session-manager-for-i3wm/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;debian currently provides some session-managers in the virtual-package x-session-manager&lt;/p&gt;

It does, however, provide session files[1] which are installed and should be available in a session manager reading those files.

I'm still not really clear on what you are talking about, unfortunately. To be fair, I'm also not a Debian user. :)</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 09:27:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7232/debian-x-session-manager-for-i3wm/?comment=7255#comment-7255</guid></item><item><title>Comment by peterN for &lt;p&gt;Are you talking about a session manager or a session definition? i3, of course, doesn't require a session manager to be present.

Actually I'd like to describe the plumbing of a debian desktop and the differences between gnome/kde/xfce and a window-manager like i3wm. I know about the i3*.desktop file. You call it a session file, because they are listed under "session" in the login screen, correct?</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:30:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7232/debian-x-session-manager-for-i3wm/?comment=7254#comment-7254</guid></item></channel></rss>
