Well, I was. Not enought karma to post a link or an attachment.

That pretty much sucks.

So I wait until I get karma and then come back with a question?

I read the link from the previous 'blue border' post answer.

So if adding client.border color might fix it, then do all attributes have to be stipulated? Border, indicator, etc.?
I currently don't have any of these window decoration colors declared.
I have open all windows with no border set. It works everywhere but with the scratchpad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 02:59:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4683/scratchpad-screen-has-blue-border/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I saw the other question but there was no screenshot.

Yes, all attributes need to be specified. The userguide contains the defaults, so if you want to use the same settings (except for the indicator color), just copy the userguide and modify only the indicator one :).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 07:52:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4683/scratchpad-screen-has-blue-border/?answer=4747#post-id-4747</guid></item><item><title>Comment by topernic for &lt;p&gt;(Meta: no links allowed is a default by Askbot, the FAQ software we use, in order to prevent spammers from posting links and boosting their websites in search engine results.)&lt;/p&gt;
