Most apps are fine but anything that relies on solid 60hz will experience frame drops and tearing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 16:22:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=2217#comment-2217</guid></item><item><title>Comment by dkeg for &lt;p&gt;try unagi. works great and out of the box with i3!&lt;/p&gt;

Documentation seems a bit light atm.  Would to see some config file examples. </description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2013 03:16:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=1842#comment-1842</guid></item><item><title>Comment by geyslan for &lt;p&gt;try unagi. works great and out of the box with i3!&lt;/p&gt;

Using "compton --backend glx" makes all the video tearing gone.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 23:41:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=2222#comment-2222</guid></item><item><title>Answer by gazliddon for &lt;p&gt;using URxvt one could use the fading variable to fade the window when it is not in focus.

Both Mame and a Javascript browser game I was devving ran at &lt; 60hz and experienced tearing when using Unagi under i3wm </description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 16:21:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?answer=2216#post-id-2216</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Kha for &lt;p&gt;using URxvt one could use the fading variable to fade the window when it is not in focus.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=1214#comment-1214</link><description>urxvt renders its window contents. i3 never interferes with window contents. A compositor does, however. Therefore, a compositor (or the app itself) can fade, while i3 cannot.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2013 17:56:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=1214#comment-1214</guid></item><item><title>Comment by dkeg for &lt;p&gt;i3 isn't a compositing window manager.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=1213#comment-1213</link><description>but URxvt's fading has nothing to do with compositing.  I'm not saying you're not correct, however URxvt already fades for me in i3, so led me to wonder if possible.  More so out of curiosity, not necessity. </description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2013 23:44:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1211/unfocused-window-fading/?comment=1213#comment-1213</guid></item></channel></rss>
