I really enjoy i3 but the following is a major issue for me:
How do I create custom keybindings that allows 'next line' and 'page down' functionality globally? For example, 'next line' is by default the down arrow and has meaning in both text editors (next line) and web-browsers (scroll down the webpage by one line). Page down has the same function in both text editors and browsers and is by default the 'Pg Dn' keyboard button. Is there a way to change next/prev line and page down/up to mod+i or mod+m keybindings globally (like in EMACS)

Thank you,

Please answer your own question if you manage to figure it out :)
