In the latest version of i3, moving a program to the scratchpad resizes the floating window to 75% of screen height and 50% of screen width.

I like the Yakuake drop down terminal emulator from KDE. It plays tricks to act as a drop down; one specifies the desired window size and it persists. If I use Yakuake with i3 and the scratchpad, resizing therefore doesn't work as expected, the effect is to **crop** the window.

Here's how I avoided the resize/crop issue: 'autostart-yakuake' is a script that uses DBUS to set up the Yakuake tabs with e.g. an emacs server and a couple of emacs clients.

    exec --no-startup-id autostart-yakuake
    for_window [instance="yakuake"] move scratchpad 
    bindsym Print [instance="yakuake"] scratchpad show, fullscreen

So, a question - could we have an option to not resize scratchpad windows please?</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2013 18:49:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2420/dropdown-terminal-in-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lompy for &lt;p&gt;I have been banging my head against the wall with this, so I thought I'd share what worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

In the answer `move` command is issued, but you can also use `resize`. For example my dropdown Urxvt config:

    ## quick terminal
    exec --no-startup-id urxvt -name metask
    for_window [instance="metask"] floating enable;
    for_window [instance="metask"] move scratchpad; [instance="metask"] scratchpad show; move position 0px 22px; resize shrink height 300px; resize grow width 683px; move scratchpad
    bindsym $mod+t [instance="metask"] scratchpad show

With that I always have terminal launched in scratchpad binded to Alt+T, positiond just beneath my system tray and resized to fit full screen width on my 1366 x 768 laptop monitor.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 16:59:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2420/dropdown-terminal-in-i3/?answer=2626#post-id-2626</guid></item><item><title>Comment by yoav for &lt;p&gt;If it's still actual there were resemble question faq.i3wm.org/question/2598/cant-auto-move-float-scratchpad-windows/.

Without that we can't move and resize autoloaded scratchpad floating windows. You would have to move to scratchpad manually. Also can applay mensioned patch which I don't know how to do.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 16:15:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2420/dropdown-terminal-in-i3/?comment=2633#comment-2633</guid></item><item><title>Answer by KJ44 for &lt;p&gt;I have been banging my head against the wall with this, so I thought I'd share what worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2420/dropdown-terminal-in-i3/?answer=3433#post-id-3433</link><description>    exec --no-startup-id terminator -l KJ
    for_window [instance="terminator"] floating enable, move scratchpad, scratchpad show;
    for_window [instance="terminator"] resize grow left 300, resize grow right 300, resize grow down 200, resize grow up 200, move scratchpad;
    bindsym Control+Menu  [instance="terminator"] scratchpad show
    bindsym Control+Print [instance="terminator"] scratchpad show

The above is a tested solution for Terminator.

Note the '-l KJ' used to load a profile. Terminator lets you define the number of tabs, their names, and the command to run in each tab. In that regard it is easier than using DBUS to achieve similar results with Yakuake
