I have found commands to move a workspace from one monitor to the other, but as I unplug my laptop often from my secondary monitor, sometimes my workspaces get kinda messy. I was wondering if there is a way to easily re-arrange workspaces, for example, by shifting it one over to the left or right in the list of my workspaces. 

A natural follow up question to this one too, I feel, is then how to re-number said workspaces in an ascending fashion should one want to. Is this possible with existing commands?
