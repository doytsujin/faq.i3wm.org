Is there any file in `/etc/acpi/event` that has *lid* in its name or mentions *lid* in it on your laptop?</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 13:45:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4357/i3-exits-when-closing-laptop-lid/?comment=4364#comment-4364</guid></item><item><title>Answer by sia for &lt;p&gt;I've updated from Xubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 and I would get random i3 crushes with lightlocker.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4357/i3-exits-when-closing-laptop-lid/?answer=5624#post-id-5624</link><description>I've had this issue also;

Everything was fine with Xubuntu 13, the upgrade to 14.04 causes i3 to crash each time the lid is closed. This is on a thinkpad R500.

no mention of lid it /etc/acpi/events, although acpi_listen *Does* register the lid opening and closing.

My presumption is that normally closing the lid would send a SIGSTOP much akin to what was alluded to in issue #1489 and #926.

I'd like to see what /etc/acpi/events/lid would look like normally, and what scripts it calls</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2015 01:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4357/i3-exits-when-closing-laptop-lid/?answer=5624#post-id-5624</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Bogos for &lt;p&gt;I've updated from Xubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 and I would get random i3 crushes with lightlocker.
