Some window managers I had used before allowed the user to disable refreshing window contents while dragging/resizing, so that only a border appeared. One could drag that border around and the screen (the window itself as well as windows behind it) was redrawn after releasing the mouse button.

Does i3 provide such a feature?</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2014 10:41:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3409/how-do-i-prevent-i3-from-refreshing-windows-contents-while-dragging/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;On my desktop dragging a floating window with mouse is laggy (not smooth).

The floating mode in *i3* is mainly intended for popups and the odd application that does not like to be resized. Therefore quite a lot features known from other (floating) window managers are not available and probably never will.

If you need to move windows quite often, consider to (re)map some keybindings:

    bindsym $mod+Shift+Up move up 200
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Down move down 200
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Left move left 200
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Right move right 200

This moves floating windows 200 pixel in the given direction. Tiled windows will ignore the number and just move windows one position in the given direction as before.
As windows are directly placed at the new position, that reduces the need for redraws.
