I've googled around and found only a suggestion to look for such functionality in the WM and not `xcalib` or other external tools.

So, any ideas for i3wm?

(I do use `xcalib -i -a` extensively, but I need more selective color inversion as well)

You may have some success by using it together with a compositing manager like *compiz*. *compton* is supposed to work well with *i3*, but I do not know if it supports color inversion.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2014 10:57:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5249/how-to-invert-colors-in-only-one-window/?answer=5252#post-id-5252</guid></item><item><title>Comment by max for &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i3&lt;/em&gt; does not support this directly.

I have found a guide on *compton* by which I created a working script and assigned a keybound it. That script works slightly different (but possibly useful) from what I intended: it inverts colors of the given *class* of windows, so all terminal windows get color-inverted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 00:08:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5249/how-to-invert-colors-in-only-one-window/?comment=5277#comment-5277</guid></item></channel></rss>
