Firstable, thanks for your awesome work!

I'm looking for a solution would allow me to open pdf files directly with my prefered application: llpp or return on a chromium's tile if I just clicked on a mail link.
Is it possible?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1925/set-chromium-and-google-chrome-open-file-action/?answer=2406#post-id-2406</link><description>I finally found solutions to my two problems, look the following

for mailto tag to use gmail, {check this link} (can't post link yet)
try 

1. Open your javascript console
1. type
`navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto",
                                  "(1)mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&amp;url=%s",
                                  "Gmail");`
1. Accept the confirmation from the browser.

(I found solution from  Paul Irish but can't post link. If someone find the link please edit my post. I'll do it as soon as I can)

Also for pdf files. I really think all pdf readers are more or less crap in Linux, to heavy or light but you just can only read from it (you don't have search options or table of contents), anyway I downloaded this from the store: check pdf.js or html5 pdf viewer on chrome/chromium store both are the pretty the same. Thoses are perfectly doing things as I expected

Hope it helps you too.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 16:23:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1925/set-chromium-and-google-chrome-open-file-action/?answer=2406#post-id-2406</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;I finally found solutions to my two problems, look the following&lt;/p&gt;

It's easy to search for, pretty lightweight but has all the features I need in 96.3% of my use cases.

Have a look at [xdg-open](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open).
