I've been using i3 for a couple of years and since it consumes nothing in cpu/ram, I'd like to use those cycles somehow while bringing more eye candy to my desktop.

Therefore I'm asking for methods to set a video as wallpaper. I currently do it by using:

    $  mplayer -loop 0 -rootwin -ao null -noconsolecontrols -fs video.avi

Sadly this only works fine in a single monitor, and gets split after adding a second screen:

This is weird because: $ mplayer -fullscreen video #works great in multi-screen, anyway, any advice is welcome.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 13:11:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1356/how-to-set-a-video-as-wallpaper/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

If you even see your wallpaper, you are using i3 wrong (windows should fill the entire screen all the times, except when switching to a new workspace)</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 13:21:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1356/how-to-set-a-video-as-wallpaper/?answer=1357#post-id-1357</guid></item><item><title>Comment by chilicuil for &lt;p&gt;If you want that kind of eye candy, please switch to E17.&lt;/p&gt;

The point is when I do it, I'd like to see an animation|video.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2013 05:56:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1356/how-to-set-a-video-as-wallpaper/?comment=1365#comment-1365</guid></item></channel></rss>
