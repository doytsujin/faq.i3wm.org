`_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE` is certainly not the right criterion to make something floating. Quote from the standard:

    _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE indicates that the window should be on top of most windows (see the section called “Stacking order” for details).
    _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW indicates that the window should be below most windows (see the section called “Stacking order” for details).
    _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW are mainly meant for user preferences and should not be used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their dialogs (the Urgency hint should be used in that case, see the section called “Urgency”).'

See http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/src/manage.c?h=next#n375 for what i3 makes floating. The most likely candidate for your case seems to be setting the leader window on the dialog window.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 19:45:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3025/considering-_net_wm_state/?answer=3026#post-id-3026</guid></item><item><title>Comment by milkypostman for &lt;p&gt;Report a bug upstream for the application this is about.&lt;/p&gt;

Also `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR`. With both of those enabled, it seems like the application doesn't want to be controlled and in most other WMs, like gnome, this causes the window to be unmanaged</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 20:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3025/considering-_net_wm_state/?comment=3028#comment-3028</guid></item></channel></rss>
