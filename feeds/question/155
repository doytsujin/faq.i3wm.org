Here it is before restart, looking nice (and automatically taking up wasted space like a champ!)

But after I restarted, it no longer had a border and WASN'T taking up that "wasted" space. It shows whatever was on the screen before it loads it.

This is pretty much the last thing I need figured out to finally make my switch over. I can log what startx yells at me when I run it and pastebin it in a minute, and see if using SLiM to start it makes a difference.

EDIT: It doesn't happen until I do `xrdb -load ~/.Xresources` and close it and open it again. :/ I'm not sure why that's an issue, but startx isn't using .Xresources so I get a WRONG terminal when I open it normally.</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2012 00:20:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/155/broken-urxvt-when-restarting-in-place/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by thevdude for &lt;p&gt;I was setting up i3 earlier and having some fun with it (I'm really digging it, it's a neat WM for sure) and ran into a problem when I restarted it in place while I was editing the config in URxvt.&lt;/p&gt;

When I originally set up my .Xresources, it was on openbox with xcompmgr, so I had compositing. This means that I had set compositing up for urxvt, which is normally fine.

Pretty much every other WM I've worked with hasn't had a problem with this either, so no big deal until now.

The background wasn't set with an alpha layer, but the line `URxvt.Depth = 32` was still there in my .Xresources. Commenting it out fixed my problem. :D</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2012 00:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/155/broken-urxvt-when-restarting-in-place/?answer=156#post-id-156</guid></item></channel></rss>
