If you are not bothered by the packages taking space on your hard drive (and sometimes being updated), I don't see too much point in caring about this. You might also consider Ubuntu spin-off that uses something light as a window manager (Lubuntu?).</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2015 01:03:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5609/best-way-to-install-i3-from-scratch-ubuntu/?comment=5611#comment-5611</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;So I have been a Ubuntu Gnome user for a while and I have recently bought a hp stream 11 which can't really handle gnome.

[*Ask Ubuntu*](would be a better place for this question). Also, [this articel about installating a minimal Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems) may help you.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2015 02:02:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5609/best-way-to-install-i3-from-scratch-ubuntu/?comment=5612#comment-5612</guid></item></channel></rss>
