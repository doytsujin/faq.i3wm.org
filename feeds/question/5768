If so, I expect everything's working properly.  i3 is not a compositing window manager, doesn't do transparency; your terminal app has transparency support built into it.  Many people use the 'compton' compositor along with i3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2015 19:08:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5768/feh-wont-work-in-xubuntu/?comment=5769#comment-5769</guid></item></channel></rss>
