Is it possible to create a keyboard shortcut that will act as 'alt' without i3 parsing it as mod key? 

The reason I'm asking for this is that I just realized that in gtk programs you can use alt+ a letter as hotkey for buttons, menus, etc, and I would like to take advantage of this functionality.
