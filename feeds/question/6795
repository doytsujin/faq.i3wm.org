This container would display all the windows as tiled; that is, every window would be made as "square" as possible within the container.  It would place the windows in a grid of equal-sized cells, but the last row might contain less than the rest.  For example:

[  w1  ][  w2  ][  w3  ]

[  w4  ][  w5  ][  w6  ]

[ wide7      ][    wide8      ]

I realize this can be stitched together from split containers.  But I'd either like the mode, or a script to auto-create a set of h/v split containers, so I can get there in one quick operation.  I'd like it to take whatever containers are on the particular workspace, and replace them all with the tiled configuration.

I could script this but the devil is in the details so I thought I would see if someone else had scripted a solution they could share.  Or an alternative solution?  Thanks, viva la i3!!</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2015 15:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6795/is-there-a-decent-tile-all-windows-i3-script/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by moodboom for &lt;p&gt;I would like a new "container" for i3, in addition to the stacked, tabbed and h/v split containers.

Just move all windows to a temporary workspace and after every n-th one, issue the commands "move down, split h".</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2015 19:15:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6795/is-there-a-decent-tile-all-windows-i3-script/?comment=6800#comment-6800</guid></item></channel></rss>
