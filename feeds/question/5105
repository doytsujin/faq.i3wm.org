bindsym $mod+n exec nautilus --no-desktop

This works to launch one instance, however, subsequent attempts fail. The only feedback is that the indicator for that workspace shows the urgent color. Launching another instance via the i3-dmenu-desktop works fine but then it launches with desktop control.

Launching the 'nautilus --no-desktop' command at a terminal produces:
** (nautilus:6210): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-p9bGA1q0zk: Connection refused

(nautilus:6210): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to register client: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files

Insync Nautilus Plugin
&lt;class 'insync_plugin.InsyncExtension'&gt;
('[__init__ insync plugin]', &lt;InsyncExtension object at 0x7fe9ec02ffa0 (uninitialized at 0x0)&gt;)

Nautilus still launches but the second attempt from terminal fails and produces:
** (nautilus:6316): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-p9bGA1q0zk: Connection refused


Other file managers work properly with the shortcuts but I'd like to either
a: figure out where my mistake is
or
b: get pointed in the right direction on finding the problem

This results in the existing nautilus window being raised, which you can observe when you have both of them on the same workspace, e.g. in a stacked container.

I think the solution you’re looking for is using `nautilus --no-desktop --new-window`, which will result in a new window being opened instead of the existing window being raised.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 22:25:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5105/how-to-create-shortcut-for-nautilus/?answer=5118#post-id-5118</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jefeyay for &lt;p&gt;By default, nautilus will only run one process and starting the nautilus binary again will only result in the new process telling the old one about it.
