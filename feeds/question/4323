Is there a way to force i3 to use only one monitor ? 
Asked differently: How to disable the second monitor completely so that i3 ignores it ?

You'll need to figure out if it's possible to set the OS X X11 layer to only display on a single Mac workspace, and set that one Mac workspace to a specific monitor. I personally don't know how to do that, though.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2014 04:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4323/force-i3-to-use-only-one-monitor-mac-os-x/?answer=4330#post-id-4330</guid></item><item><title>Comment by syl20bnr for &lt;p&gt;Which monitors are used by the X server is controlled by Xorg itself, at a lower level than the window manager.

I looked into the monitor configuration for X and it seems that it is not trivial. Since I use i3 almost exclusively for urxvt and terminal stuff, I can bear with the limitations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 21:27:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4323/force-i3-to-use-only-one-monitor-mac-os-x/?comment=4370#comment-4370</guid></item></channel></rss>
