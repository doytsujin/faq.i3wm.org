I found the recent update has changed the screen display after a new workspace is activated. For example, after I pressed win+3 to activate a new workspace 3 under workspace 1, the screen kept on displaying the contents in workspace 1. However, according to the indicator at the lowerleft of the screen, I have already been switched into workspace 3. 

In fact, If I open a new window, say, a terminal, after pressed win+3, the screen would change from displaying the contents in workspace 1 to the newly opened terminal in workspace 3. This is a bit annoying as previously the screen will respond promptly after the new window been activated. Actually the similar thing happens when the last window of a workspace is closed.

How can I change back to the old settings which I got used to? </description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 11:22:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3348/screen-displays-the-content-of-the-old-workspace-after-new-workspace-being-activated/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Currently I am running i3 version 4.6 in Gentoo with 3.10.25 kernel. &lt;/p&gt;

Or rather lack of redrawing. It seems that that there is no background (color or image) set for the X11 root window. As i3 itself does not touch the root window, X has no reason to draw anything (even just a solid background) if there are no windows and a image of the previous content remains.

Most likely this isn't even a problem with the last update of i3, but some other X11 component or setting. An easy solution is to set a background yourself, [see here fro some ideas on how to do this](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6/how-can-i-set-a-desktop-background-image-in-i3/).</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 13:08:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3348/screen-displays-the-content-of-the-old-workspace-after-new-workspace-being-activated/?answer=3352#post-id-3352</guid></item><item><title>Comment by diablo465 for &lt;p&gt;This sounds like a redrawing problem.

But the previous versions can work properly without setting a background.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 14:48:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3348/screen-displays-the-content-of-the-old-workspace-after-new-workspace-being-activated/?comment=3353#comment-3353</guid></item></channel></rss>
