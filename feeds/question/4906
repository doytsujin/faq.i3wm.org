I'm trying to get my (useless) caps lock key to behave as the "iso level 3" shift, i.e typing "&lt;level 3&gt;+'e" composes the character "é".

As usual, I suspect i3 has an easy way to do that, but I couldn't find any examples anywhere?

Thanks a lot!</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 07:35:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4906/bind-caps-lock-to-the-compose-key/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Also, *i3* itself does not have an easy way to do that. Have a look at [this qestion on *Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange*](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108207/how-to-map-caps-lock-as-the-compose-key-using-xmodmap-portably-and-idempotently)</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:19:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4906/bind-caps-lock-to-the-compose-key/?comment=4908#comment-4908</guid></item></channel></rss>
