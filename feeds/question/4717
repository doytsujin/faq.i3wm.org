In any case, what I'd really like is a file manager with nice shortcuts that somehow gets used by all (most) x applications in their "open" or "save" dialogs, that has some shortcut for that. I don't really know how that works, but I doubt a terminal file manager like "ranger" would do for that.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4717/x-file-manager-with-nice-keyboard-shortcuts/?answer=4718#post-id-4718</link><description>Check out spacefm.  Its entirely possible to bind not only normal actions to keys but custom scripts to be run on the targeted file. Pretty neat.

Incidentally in dolphin I have bound : to toggle the terminal below the file manager window (note terminal NOT open terminal here) and use autojump in the terminal portion to jump around efficiently.   Wherever you jump to in the terminal the GUI will follow.  

Additionally instead of using split view which lacks a binding to switch between sides I simply open 2 file managers which means I can use the regular navigation hotkeys.

As a result I can use dolphin without hardly touching the mouse.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 01:49:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4717/x-file-manager-with-nice-keyboard-shortcuts/?answer=4718#post-id-4718</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;Check out spacefm.

Do you know how to make some file manager become the standard for the "open" or "save" dialogs of applications (if that is possible)?</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 03:13:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4717/x-file-manager-with-nice-keyboard-shortcuts/?comment=4719#comment-4719</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;The thing that nowadays drives me most often to pick up the mouse is when browsing for files, in an open or save dialog.

It has some hard coded keyboard shortcuts to switch between Toolbar, Folder View and Side Pane.

    F6: change focus Side pane &lt;-&gt; Folder view  
    Ctrl+L or Alt+D: jump focus to Path Bar  

See Help &gt; Keyboard Navigation for the rest of available shortcuts.
