For example, I start with two urxvtc's arranged left and right. With the focus on the right, I use $mod+enter to create a third urxvtc (in second shot). Then I used C-d to kill the right-most urxvtc. i3 then restores the previously middle urxvtc (with text, "Now is the time for all good men..." to it's previous size and position on the right half of the screen, but it's clear that a good-size fraction of the text on the right side of that right-most urxvtc is now gone. And that text is really gone. I had thought that highlighting that section of the urxvtc with the touchpad would reveal it was still there but hidden some how. But no; it's gone.

You are probably using `bash` which does not immediatelly redraw the command line when the terminal window is resized. That is the reason why the text you are entering on the prompt seems to be cut off rather than rewrapped like the text in the left window.

If you type anything on the second terminal, the whole text will be restored. In the second screenshot it would be rewrapped. In the third screenshot the cut-off parts would re-appear. Also, in some cases - e.g. initial input on small terminal, then resize to be wider - some text artefacts may remain in the same position if they are after the new end of line position.

If this really annoys you, you might consider switching to `zsh`, which does not seem to have this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 13:40:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5463/i3-is-disappearing-text-from-my-urxvtc/?answer=5485#post-id-5485</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Gamonics for &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an issue with &lt;em&gt;i3&lt;/em&gt;.

What you've written makes sense to me, but strangely, I now can no longer reproduce the behavior in the screenshots above. So I'm unable to test and verify your explanation. I'll consider zsh. I'd up-vote your answer (I know voting's REALLY important here), but I've used all 30 votes today.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 20:09:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5463/i3-is-disappearing-text-from-my-urxvtc/?comment=5487#comment-5487</guid></item></channel></rss>
