 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3525/replacing-i3bar-with-tint2/?answer=3714#post-id-3714</link><description>Aha, if you want a transparent i3bar, you might be better off with a compositor like [Compton](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/). You can define that also a ``dock`` window type needs to be transparent: 

    wintypes:
    {
      dock = { opacity = 0.6 };
    };

1: Change the tint2 source code so that it communicates with i3 like i3bar does. See http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html and the i3bar source code itself.

2: The window that tint2 opens needs to set a hint stating that it’s a dock window. Then, i3 will place it at the bottom (or top, depending on the window’s hint) of the screen.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:55:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3525/replacing-i3bar-with-tint2/?answer=3675#post-id-3675</guid></item></channel></rss>
