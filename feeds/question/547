This version does not seem to honor the '-i' option for setting a PNG image. (just in case, I tried with a JPG too, still no luck)

I've found in a [question](http://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image) on this very faq website mentioned that in Fedora the '-i' is not compiled in. Is that the case for Precise too? (however, both the man page and the usage '--help' message have the '-i image.PNG' option shown as available).

**Update:** Actually i3lock works ok, but the problem lies with the Ubuntu default background file and is quite silly: I was attempting to set as image "`/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png`" (which happens to be the default background used by Precise, the one I am currently using as background now and the only .png file in that directory, the others being .jpg). However, despite having a .png extension, that image file is actually a JPEG ... :| (a tiny warning on stderr that the image failed to load or is not a valid png could help in similar situations, but it's up to you)&lt;br&gt;

I just changed the code to print it always since I don’t see any reason for having that in debug mode only. Unfortunately, the message doesn’t give a good reason (like "you passed a JPEG file"), improvements  welcome.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 09:23:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/547/i3lock-setting-the-image-background-in-ubuntu-precise/?comment=554#comment-554</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;The version included in the Ubuntu Precise repository is "i3lock: version 2.2 (2011-11-06) © 2010-2011 Michael Stapelberg".

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/547/i3lock-setting-the-image-background-in-ubuntu-precise/?answer=548#post-id-548</link><description>You can verify whether it should work by using

    ldd $(which i3lock) | grep cairo

If that prints a line such as the following one, your version of i3lock has been compiled with cairo support:

	libcairo.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcairo.so.2 (0x00007f170526f000)

Note that the presence of the -i flag in the --help message should be a definitive indicator, too (unless the distribution messes with our source code).</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 12:27:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/547/i3lock-setting-the-image-background-in-ubuntu-precise/?answer=548#post-id-548</guid></item></channel></rss>
