    bindsym $mod+r exec i3-input -F 'rename workspace to "%s"' -P 'New name: '

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3396/error-when-attempting-to-rename-workspace/?answer=3397#post-id-3397</link><description>It seems that you are using an older version of i3, where renaming the focused workspace was not yet implemented. This feature was introduced with version 4.4.

Before that only explicit renaming was possible:

    rename workspace "old_name" to "new_name"

I got i3 off the software center, is this not the latest version? [EDIT] it seems that I am unable to get the newest version because I am running 12.04, my bad.  Is there anyway for me to get the latest version on my current distro?
