currently I am using i3bar configured with mode=hide to only show when a dedicated key is pressed. But this does not come in handy when using a tray in the i3bar, because pressing a key while moving a mouse to access some menu in the tray is not comfortable. Is there any known way to toggle between showing and hiding the bar by pressing the corresponding modifier key?
