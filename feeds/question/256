I'd like to ask with what kind of setup you browse. Specifically, how do you quickly find your tabs? Did you find a solution for when you have more tabs open than fit in, let's say, 160 horizontal pixels? How do you keep history, cache and other state data consistent between the different browser instances? </description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 18:45:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jameshfisher for &lt;p&gt;From the floating window manager paradigm, tabbed browsing is ${deity}sent.

I am using dwb http://portix.bitbucket.org/dwb/ without tabs, but have not yet managed to share cookies etc between browsing windows. There are options for the major vendors, but hidden somewhere in about:config or similar. </description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2014 06:47:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/?comment=3386#comment-3386</guid></item><item><title>Answer by qed for &lt;p&gt;From the floating window manager paradigm, tabbed browsing is ${deity}sent.

Now when you click on any link, hold down the shift key, to force it to open in a new window, and that new window will become a new tab in i3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2013 20:36:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/?answer=2860#post-id-2860</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;From the floating window manager paradigm, tabbed browsing is ${deity}sent.

That is exactly what i don't want. www-rendering is the job of a browser. Tiling/tabbing/stacking/floating: That is what I chose my window manager for. There is no need to confuse the two domains of excellence. </description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 21:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/?comment=259#comment-259</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;Firefox with Vertical Tabs addon&lt;/p&gt;
</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/?comment=266#comment-266</link><description>Well I for one am not sure how expensive it is to have windows vs tabs. Although with amounts of RAM these days it might be irrelevant. But the second thing is that i3 can't provide vertical tabs AFAICS. This is essential for any landscape format display for efficient space use.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2012 09:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/256/how-to-let-i3-manage-tabbed-browsing/?comment=266#comment-266</guid></item></channel></rss>
