&gt; When you are in fullscreen mode, some applications still open popup windows (take Xpdf for example). This is because these applications may not be aware that they are in fullscreen mode (they do not check the corresponding hint). There are three things which are possible to do in this situation:

&gt;    - Display the popup if it belongs to the fullscreen application only. This is the default and should be reasonable behavior for most users.
&gt;    - Just ignore the popup (don’t map it). This won’t interrupt you while you are in fullscreen. However, some apps might react badly to this (deadlock until you go out of fullscreen).
&gt;    - Leave fullscreen mode.

Can we have a fourth option to allow all floating windows be in front of window currently in fullscreen?

Or better: we can create a for_window option to turn a specific floating window not hidden when another window is fullscreen.

Good example: the tomighty is a pomodoro app with a clock to better organize my study and work. So, this little clock widget could be always shown even if my ebook is fullscreen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 16:06:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3482/all-floating-windows-in-front-of-fullscreen-one/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Now we have 3 options of the behaviour of popup windows in fullscreen mode:&lt;/p&gt;

Applications should not rely on floating windows that are stacked on top of each other — avoiding this is the reason why we use a tiling WM in the first place.

Therefore, I suggest you find/write a pomodoro app that better fits into the tiling landscape. Maybe you can use freedesktop notifications and dunst to display them.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2014 10:40:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3482/all-floating-windows-in-front-of-fullscreen-one/?answer=3683#post-id-3683</guid></item></channel></rss>
