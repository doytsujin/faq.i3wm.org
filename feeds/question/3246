I am using imagej (a java program for manipulating images) which is started by default in floating mode.
Normally, when you have more than one image (window) open, you select with the mouse the window you want and then you can select an operation from the menu window (like filter or whatever) and the operation is applied on the last selected window. 

When I use it in i3 the operation is always performed on the first opened window.

DO you have any suggestion or explanation on why this happens?

Cheers

I just tested it with i3-4.7 and imagej-1.47a and everything seemed to work as intended. </description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 12:04:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3246/imagej-floating-windows-selection/?comment=3248#comment-3248</guid></item><item><title>Comment by heiserhorn for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

`focus_follows_mouse no`

will fix the behaviour.
