The second value listed on that line is the window class you need. For Skype, it's "Skype", and for Thunderbird it's "Thunderbird". Note that both of these are case sensetive.

The first value listed under "WM_CLASS" is the window's "instance", which can also be matched against in i3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2014 19:25:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3629/applications-on-startup-to-right-workspace/?answer=3630#post-id-3630</guid></item></channel></rss>
