Found this out, but I still can't get - and | to work as special keys (I want them to split windows tmux-style). Any takers?</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 19:35:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4158/how-do-i-use-special-characters-as-keys-in-the-config-file/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by brakende for &lt;p&gt;As ø takes the place of ; on Norwegian keyboards, I want to use $mod+ø instead of $mod+; for the vimmish "focus right".&lt;/p&gt;

    bindcode $mod+34 [class="Konsole"] scratchpad show
    bindcode $mod+35 [class="Google-chrome|X-www-browser"] scratchpad show

These hotkeys work in different layouts (english and russian for me). To get the code of specific key use xev tool. Example output from xev tool for the "[" key:

    KeyPress event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0x4200001,
        root 0x9e, subw 0x0, time 156960544, (621,116), root:(623,155),
        state 0x10, keycode 34 (keysym 0x5b, bracketleft), same_screen YES,
        XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (5b) "["
        XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (5b) "["
        XFilterEvent returns: False

As you can see on the third line keycode of this key is 34.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 20:32:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4158/how-do-i-use-special-characters-as-keys-in-the-config-file/?answer=4250#post-id-4250</guid></item><item><title>Answer by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;As ø takes the place of ; on Norwegian keyboards, I want to use $mod+ø instead of $mod+; for the vimmish "focus right".&lt;/p&gt;
