I think, it's possible to create a dialog, which will be shown when new workspace is created.

It will just show the focused text field, where you can write name for your workspace, and this name will be shown in the i3bar next to the number of workspace.

It would be much easier to navigate between workspaces if they're named, and it would be easier to name workspace when you opening it.

Also, there could be another dialog in the i3 to rename currently opened workspace.

Who knows how to do it?</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 13:22:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4725/workspace-name-dialog/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

This is also documented in the userguide, so please read that closely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 07:43:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4725/workspace-name-dialog/?comment=4740#comment-4740</guid></item><item><title>Comment by NonGrate for &lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces"&gt;the userguide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

And is there possibility to access renamed workspaces relatively to the number they had?</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 13:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4725/workspace-name-dialog/?comment=4727#comment-4727</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lasers for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

You could bind i3-input or make your own script using dmenu or zenity (for input). There are probably few on the web too if you can find them. Here's an example for i3-input.

    bindsym $mod+z exec i3-input ; mode "default"

Launch i3-input and type this. `rename workspace to web`

This is useful because you can do more than just renaming a workspace.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 13:49:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4725/workspace-name-dialog/?answer=4728#post-id-4728</guid></item></channel></rss>
