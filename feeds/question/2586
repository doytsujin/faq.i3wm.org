</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2586/semantics-of-move-command/?comment=2589#comment-2589</link><description>Thanks. It seems like the move/focus commands are mostly about "doing the right thing" with respect to the screen layout, but is not very well defined intuitively (at least for my intuition) for tree manipulation... I'd like to play with more direct tree manipulation -- is it possible via ipc?</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 20:40:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2586/semantics-of-move-command/?comment=2589#comment-2589</guid></item><item><title>Comment by yoav for &lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWA8Pl57UBY"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWA8Pl...&lt;/a&gt; and toy around with it, and/or read the source.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2586/semantics-of-move-command/?comment=2604#comment-2604</link><description>Itâ€™s not. The commands that are exposed via the IPC interface are exactly what is documented in the userguide, i.e. what is available for you to bind on your keys.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 16:43:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2586/semantics-of-move-command/?comment=2604#comment-2604</guid></item></channel></rss>
