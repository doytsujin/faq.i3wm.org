A defined binding has to be matched exactly by the pressed keys for i3 to act on it. So in this sense every key of a binding really is required. Also if more modifier keys are pressed, i3 will ignore the combination completely unless it, too, is bound.


----------


As for the problem described. I did some testing, but could not reproduce the described effect. So this does not seem to be a problem with i3 in general. Two things come to mind:

 1. Your Mod4 key does not work at all. Could test with `xev -event keyboard` if pressing the `&lt;Mod4&gt;` actually does anything. (Note: it is possible to bind single modifier keys in i3 by using `bindcode`. This would prevent `xev` (or any other program) from catching the key, but it does not lead to `&lt;Control&gt;+&lt;Mod4&gt;+a` to be interpreted as `&lt;Control&gt;+a` (at least on my computer).)

 2. One or more of your programs behave strangely and accept `&lt;Control&gt;+&lt;Mod4&gt;+a` as substitute for `&lt;Control&gt;+a` or ignore `&lt;Mod4&gt;` completely. Could you give a list or at least some examples of programs with which you have the problem?

Also, what does happen if you do bind `&lt;Control&gt;+&lt;Mod4&gt;+a` to something in i3?</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 18:51:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2868/how-do-i-make-sure-that-when-i-press-a-meta-key-and-another-key-that-both-keys-are-required/?answer=2872#post-id-2872</guid></item><item><title>Comment by paramnesioid for &lt;p&gt;In answer to the question: Key bindings in i3 are a list of modifiers (Control, Shift, Mod1 - Mod5 and Mode_Switch) plus a keycode or keysym.

In Xterm and the terminal that comes with Xfce (?), in Xfce when I press Control-Mod4-a in either it won't do anything (it won't do Control-a instead), but in i3 (nothing is set to Control-Mod4-a) and it will do what Control-a does (go to the start of the line). </description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 02:52:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2868/how-do-i-make-sure-that-when-i-press-a-meta-key-and-another-key-that-both-keys-are-required/?comment=2899#comment-2899</guid></item><item><title>Comment by paramnesioid for &lt;p&gt;In answer to the question: Key bindings in i3 are a list of modifiers (Control, Shift, Mod1 - Mod5 and Mode_Switch) plus a keycode or keysym.

My Mod4/Windows key does work. I should've paid more attention to where I was doing it.

All my terminal emulators behave the same way. Textfields in Firefox do, too. But no select all with `Control+Mod4+a` in gimp or gwenview although just `Control+a` does just that. I'm guessing it is application specific, but Xfce seems to do something. Other WMs, too?</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 08:01:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2868/how-do-i-make-sure-that-when-i-press-a-meta-key-and-another-key-that-both-keys-are-required/?comment=2900#comment-2900</guid></item></channel></rss>
