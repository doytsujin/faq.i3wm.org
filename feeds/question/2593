 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2593/tabbed-layout-for-skype-chats/?answer=3470#post-id-3470</link><description>OK, this isn't a way to automate, as you and I would like, but it's a workaround. It relies on the observation that one's Skype username is in the title of the Contacts Window. 

The Contacts Window is in the scratchpad, so you can toggle its visibility with a key; the Chat Windows remain tiled. Thus, when you lay out the tiled Chat Windows as tabbed or stacked, you exclude the Contacts Window.

    # Skype.                                                                                                                                                             
    for_window [instance="skype" title="G12ES"] floating enable, move scratchpad, scratchpad show;
    bindsym $mod+backslash [instance="skype" title="G12ES"] scratchpad show;

Unfortunately it seems one can't assign the floating scratchpad window to a workspace, but one can assign the tiled Chat windows to a workspace.

### UPDATE ###

I have abandoned the floating window approach. I now (1) fire up Skype in a workspace (2) enter my special "workspace layout" mode (3) type 's k y' and hey presto I have the contacts window on the left and a stacking container on the left (a terminal). If I then (4) open a chat window, it appears stacked in the terminal container. This is a  vile hack ...

    mode "Layout" {
    
        # Skype.
