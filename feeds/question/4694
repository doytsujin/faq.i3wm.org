I would like to set the i3 wallpaper the same as in Unity. Sadly some of the unity settings are not transfered to i3. Is it possible to use those without installing feh or other tools to further customize i3?

I've found that `--bg-fill` option of feh is more elastic, because if another output is connected, the background image scaling will be more predictable on all outputs regardless of outputs config (for example those exec statements for xrandr with output settings)

Example:

`exec --no-startup-id feh --bg-fill /path/to/image.png`

in ~/.i3/config

Also, any settings that *seem* to be transfered from unity to *i3* are not specific to *Unity* at all. For example, themes and fonts used by applications may be changed by *Unity* but the configuration files do not belong to *Unity* (much like the wallpaper can be set by *Unity* but also by other programs).

----

Example `nitrogen`:

1. Install the package *nitrogen*: `sudo apt-get install nitrogen`
2. Start `nitrogen`
3. Set directories containing wallpapers in *Preferences* 
4. Select wallpaper and *Apply*
5. Add `exec --no-startup-id nitrogen --restore` to `~/.i3/config` in order to restore wallpaper on *i3* restart.

And with 185KB it probably won't take up too much space on your disk.

With following line added to your ~/.i3/config file your done;
