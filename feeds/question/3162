    opacity-rule = ["85:class_g = 'Termite'"];

Just replace `Termite` by whatever your terminal emulator is, and `85` by the percentage of opacity you want.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3162/terminal-transparency-in-i3/?answer=4472#post-id-4472</link><description>to get a real transparency you can add to your .i3/config file the line:
exec xcompmgr -c -f -n 

and install xcompmgr, it seems to be present on every package manager like apt, entropy, yum, portage, pacman/aur and so on..


(Terminator transparency don't work as a full transparency on i3 without some compositing manager, by the way)</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:30:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3162/terminal-transparency-in-i3/?answer=4472#post-id-4472</guid></item><item><title>Answer by thesoundman20 for &lt;p&gt;How can I achieve transparency effect in Konsole (KDE terminal) or any other terminal emulator with i3?
