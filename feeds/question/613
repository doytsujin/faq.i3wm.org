Workspace 1 contains two xterms vertically split and workspace 2 contains two xterms vertically split.  `focus_follows_mouse` is set to `yes` and all window borders are set to one pixel.

When switching workspaces with $mod-NUM, the windows that were most recently focused in each workspace remain focused irrespective of the mouse pointer position in the newly entered workspace.  Is it possible to always force window focus to be under the mouse pointer?

My question may also be related to [this post](http://faq.i3wm.org/question/363/mouse-behaviour-while-switch-between-titleless/), so I apologize if this is a duplicate.
