Every execution of i3-msg seem to be generating this error message in the /tmp/i3-${USER}.*/errorlog.${PID} log file.  The i3-msg command appears to execute correctly and has a zero exit status, so I'm not sure why it's displaying that error message.  I was researching a different issue (all workspaces other than '1' have the urgent flag set on startup) and noticed these error messages.

One example of a command that runs fine and does what it's supposed to do, but still generates the same error message in the log file.
