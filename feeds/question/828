After considerable Googling, it seems that one solution is to hack my /etc/acpi/lid.sh to issue a pm-suspend.  However that seems pretty intrusive, and I was wondering whether anyone had a better suggestion?

I believe that Gnome et al run a separate power daemon to monitor the lid and configurably suspend etc - am I missing something already in i3wm or is this something that perhaps could be added?
