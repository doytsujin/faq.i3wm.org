Having the same thing displayed twice makes it look cluttered, not mention it's redundant.
Here's what my bar section looks like:

`bar {
mode dock
position top
font pango: cure 10
workspace_buttons yes
tray_output none
status ~/.i3./conky.sh
}`</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 08:15:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;I'm using a setup with dual portrait displays, and I'm wondering if there is a way to have i3status on the 2nd display only.

See [i3 user's guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar), section 5.6

Edit: Okay, this way also the workspace buttons are removed. If you don't want that but just remove the status bar, just create a second bar section in the config without a status command, c.f. the complete example in section 5.6 of the user's guide.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 09:39:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/?answer=2719#post-id-2719</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;output [output name]&lt;/code&gt; in the bar section of your i3 config file to specify where the bar should be shown.

In that case the outputs would be named `xinerama-0` and `xinerama-1` no matter what `xrandr` says. This was [needed for older nVidia drivers](http://i3wm.org/docs/multi-monitor.html) and you may no longer need it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 11:49:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/?comment=2833#comment-2833</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;output [output name]&lt;/code&gt; in the bar section of your i3 config file to specify where the bar should be shown.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/?comment=2723#comment-2723</link><description>Sorry, I'm really bad at troubleshooting. When I use output DVI-I-3 in the bar section and reload i3, i3bar disappears. I can still move between workspaces, but the bar is gone entirely. I've tried DVI-I-2, as well, with same results, as well as DVI2 and DVI3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/?comment=2723#comment-2723</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Greymon for &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;output [output name]&lt;/code&gt; in the bar section of your i3 config file to specify where the bar should be shown.

It just doesn't work, or do you get some kind of an error? Sure you wrote it correct? I think there are people here that are working with devices exactly named like yours...</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2718/i3status-on-secondary-monitor-only/?comment=2722#comment-2722</guid></item></channel></rss>
