It *is* possible. The [documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) contains a short example. You need to write a script that opens a layout and launches your applications simultaneously. That's really the only way to do it, and I can't imagine anything more straight-forward.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 14:30:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5033/how-to-launch-layout-with-applications/?answer=5084#post-id-5084</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cutuchiqueno for &lt;blockquote&gt;
