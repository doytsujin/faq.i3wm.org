When Skype displays a notification window, it appears at the lower right corner of the (virtual) screen. The problem is: It does not check whether there is actually a monitor displaying that part. In my case, it appears in the 300-pixel gap below the external screen. Please see the **[image visualizing the problem](http://picpaste.de/i3-skype-notifications.png)**.

Blue is the whole virtual screen area, yellow my internal display, green the external one. The invisible Skype notification ("Skype A") is shown in dark grey. It's especially annoying if the notification being displayed is an incoming call, because there doesn't seem to be any other way to accept it than clicking on that notification.

I am able to see some notifications if I receive enough in a short amount of time to make them stack over each other (shown as "Skype B" and "Skype C").

Now I know that this is probably not an i3 problem, but maybe you guys have an idea on how to fix it. I've tried `for_window [class="^Skype$" instance="^skype$" title="^skype$"] floating enable`, but this doesn't seem to have any effect on these windows.

Any ideas?

There is a [workaround in the official Skype forums](http://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/I-m-not-able-to-see-the-incoming-call-pop-up-window/m-p/639417#M1300) and an unanswered [question on Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/338031/skype-answer-button-appearing-off-screen-on-multi-monitor-linux-setup) about that topic.

&gt; Skype &gt; Options &gt; Notifications &gt;
&gt; click Advanced View button

Then for, say, a chat message received, uncheck display popup, and check the execute following script checkbox:

    notify-send "%sname says %smessage" -i skype -u normal -t 5000

Click Test Event button and you should see the notification placed on whichever monitor has mouse focus.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/960/dual-screen-skype-notifications-appear-off-screen/?answer=961#post-id-961</link><description>Well, one way to get around this is to configure your outputs in such a way that the bottom edge is aligned (e.g. with --pos 0x180).

The other way is to enable the workaround from the Skype forums and _then_ use `for_window`. The reason it doesn’t work right now is probably because Skype tells the window manager to not manpage the popup. That is normal behavior for Chrome’s desktop notifications, too, or dunst’s notification popups.

The "move absolute position" command (http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_focusing_moving_containers, only for floating windows) might come in handy, too, but also only after telling Skype to open a normal window.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 18:41:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/960/dual-screen-skype-notifications-appear-off-screen/?answer=961#post-id-961</guid></item></channel></rss>
