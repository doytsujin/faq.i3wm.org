Unfortunately, when I move a workspace, the mouse/pointer/focus follow along, which means having to drag it back to where I want it if I'm not done with the mode.

Apparently `mouse_warping` isn't a command but a configuration directive (distinction between these in the userguide does **not** seem very clear to me), so it seems it's either on (`output`) or off (`none`) for the entire environment.

What I'd like to do is have a binding such as

    bindsym $mod+Shift+w  mouse_warping none ; mode "wsmgr" ; mouse_warping output

or, even better, a `mouse_warping toggle` mechanism.

(As far as that goes, it's unclear whether a semi-colon entries following a `mode` command are actionable..)

And you need to post your use case and what you want and Michael can decide whether this feature will be accepted. Someone still needs to implement it then, though.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2015 21:04:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5950/changing-mouse_warping-at-runtime/?comment=5959#comment-5959</guid></item><item><title>Comment by GenghisKen for &lt;p&gt;You're right, it's not possible for the reasons you mentioned.

Or that it'll be evaluated like any other FR?
