It follows the color of the background, which seems to contradict section 4.15 of the docs:

&gt; The indicator color is used for indicating where a new window will be opened. For horizontal split containers, the right border will be painted in indicator color, for vertical split containers, the bottom border.

I'd prefer it not follow that color (the background).  Does anyone know a way around 
this?

info: I also have borders disabled.

It confused me as well.  3 possibilities jump out at me:  1, there is an extra command needed to hide the indicator.  2, one can't hide the indicator.  3, there is a defect wherein the indicator color setting doesn't work, and it gets shown when borders are disabled.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 11:19:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4996/cant-seem-to-get-rid-of-indicator/?comment=5022#comment-5022</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with colors and themes and I've realized I can't seem to not have an indicator.

The reason you can see the indicatoris, that it is actually **not** following the background color for focused and urgent windows. The background color is the one actually used for the window borders whereas the border color is only for the borders of the title bar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 12:09:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4996/cant-seem-to-get-rid-of-indicator/?answer=5023#post-id-5023</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Try this:&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4996/cant-seem-to-get-rid-of-indicator/?comment=5024#comment-5024</link><description>i think you may misunderstand.  setting the indicator color does absolutely nothing, it always follows the background.  for me, its always following the window background color.  changing the other colors does what the docs describe.  

the changes you described have no apparent change.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 14:16:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4996/cant-seem-to-get-rid-of-indicator/?comment=5024#comment-5024</guid></item><item><title>Comment by drak3 for &lt;p&gt;Try this:&lt;/p&gt;
