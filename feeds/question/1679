The reason I am asking is that I think this would be a good way to implement a sort of "video game mode" where you wouldn't need to worry about your i3 keybindings clobbering those of the application.

The most ideal situation would be the ability to add a line in the config file like:

`i3_listen_toggle $mod+t`

Though I am not opposed to a solution using i3-msg and scripting.

For isntance my vim shortcuts would be the same as i3 and each time I focused a vim terminal, I would like to go in passthrough mode. Is that possible ? that is to react on focus events ?</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2013 11:37:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1679/toggle-i3s-listening-behavior/?comment=1813#comment-1813</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I was wondering if it would be possible to create a keybinding that would toggle on/off all of i3's keybindings (except the same toggle key)?&lt;/p&gt;

Make two config files, one for each situation that you desire. i3.conf would be a symlink to one of the two. Make a command that toggles where your i3.conf-symlink refers to, before reloading the config. Maybe you need to make sure in your startup file that the one with the key syms is loaded. </description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2013 05:41:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1679/toggle-i3s-listening-behavior/?answer=1680#post-id-1680</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Matt for &lt;p&gt;Not possible, except with ugly hacks.
