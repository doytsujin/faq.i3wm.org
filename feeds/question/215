Issues below are not limited to just my sample application, KeePass 2. Picasa also behaves similarly so I'm pretty sure this is a wine-wide issue. 

**How to reproduce**

 1. Start with single monitor
 2. Install [Windows version of KeePass 2](http://keepass.info) in wine
 3. Run KeePass, minimize into system tray (*all is fine for now*)
 4. plug in another monitor, do something like 
&gt; xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --output HDMI1 --auto --above LVDS1 --primary

Observe "Wine System Tray" becoming an unpainted ghost window into window manager control and the KeePass system tray icon disappearing with no way to return it.

Observe there is no way to maximize the Wine app window on the bigger monitor.

Observe various broken drawing behavior when you send the workspace from one output to another.

Any clues about how to attack this?</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 16:43:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/215/how-to-fix-some-wine-application-issues-when-hotplugging-monitors/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;I encountered the same issues with Awesome WM so I'm pretty sure now it's something to do with how Wine works things.

This improves many window painting issues. It doesn't solve them, but improves.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 12:06:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/215/how-to-fix-some-wine-application-issues-when-hotplugging-monitors/?comment=237#comment-237</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;I encountered the same issues with Awesome WM so I'm pretty sure now it's something to do with how Wine works things.

Wine windows like Picasa and KeePass now safely stay within in their tiled containers even across xrandr layout changes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2012 07:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/215/how-to-fix-some-wine-application-issues-when-hotplugging-monitors/?answer=309#post-id-309</guid></item></channel></rss>
