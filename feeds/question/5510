Whenever I am in non tabbed layout, "focus right" activates window on the right workspace on the laptop.

Can I prevent this behaviour? Like, to configure to never go out of current workspace.

Btw, I already have `force_focus_wrapping yes` to prevent "focus left/right" going to other workspace in tabbed layout.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 12:32:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5510/prevent-focus-command-leave-current-workspace-in-multi-monitor-setup/</guid></item></channel></rss>
