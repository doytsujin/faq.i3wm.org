 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1977/why-is-the-i3-irc-channel-not-on-freenode/?answer=1978#post-id-1978</link><description>Several reasons:

 1. We host our own git repository and don’t rely on GitHub either. It’s consistent to also host our own IRC network. Decentralized services are a good thing.
 2. FreeNode in particular, but any of the bigger networks — in my experience — has a lot of netsplits, which is annoying
 3. By using a separate server, we separate the wheat from the chaff: people who just join the channel easily to ask a troll question don’t bother. However, the annoyance for people who are genuinely interested is not big enough either, since all IRC clients support multiple servers easily.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2013 13:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1977/why-is-the-i3-irc-channel-not-on-freenode/?answer=1978#post-id-1978</guid></item></channel></rss>
