I've been trying for so many hours to find a way to place a sound applet in the system tray which hooks into whatever application is playing music and allows me to change the track. I just can't do it :(

I've tried to get Indicator-Applet to work with i3bar, but i'm guessing it will only work in gnome bar? What about the applet in cinnamon(the DE/WM I came from), can that be made to work with i3bar?

What other options do I have?

Thanks a lot for any help!</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2012 21:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/948/i3bar-sound-notifier-with-song-switching/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
