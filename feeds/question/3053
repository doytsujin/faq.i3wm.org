Every key symbol on the numeric pad starts with `KP_`

For the numbers (with NumLock enabled) that is 

    KP_0
    KP_1
    KP_2
    ...
    KP_9

There are also:

    KP_Add
    KP_Subtract
    KP_Multiply
    KP_Divide
    KP_Enter
    KP_Separator

The navigational keys (with NumLock disabled) send key symbols with leading `KP_`, too, such as

    KP_Up
    KP_Home
    KP_Delete
    ...

So, instead of (or in addition to)

    bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1
    bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2
    ...

you need these lines

    bindsym $mod+KP_1 workspace 1
    bindsym $mod+KP_2 workspace 2
    ...

Also, for the binding it does not matter, whether NumLock is enabled. Bindings with `KP_1` will work even when NumLock is disabled, as will bindings with `KP_End` if NumLock is enabled. This also means, that you cannot bind different functions depending on the state of NumLock.

In general, you can alwasy use `xev` to get the symbol of a key. Start it with `xev -event keyboard` from a terminal and make the appearing window ('Event Tester') floating. Any Key you press while the focus is on the 'Event Tester' window should produce an output that looks like this:

    KeyPress event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
        root 0x25a, subw 0x0, time 546217033, (42,122), root:(2833,555),
        state 0x0, keycode 87 (keysym 0xffb1, KP_1), same_screen YES,
        XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (31) "1"
        XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (31) "1"
        XFilterEvent returns: False

    KeyRelease event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
        root 0x25a, subw 0x0, time 546217105, (42,122), root:(2833,555),
        state 0x0, keycode 87 (keysym 0xffb1, KP_1), same_screen YES,
        XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (31) "1"
        XFilterEvent returns: False

Exceptions are some special keys (mostly on Laptops) that do not send any key event and keys (key combinations) whose events are grabbed globally by another program, that includes key bindings in i3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 09:41:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3053/how-do-i-change-workspace-with-the-numeric-pad/?answer=3063#post-id-3063</guid></item><item><title>Answer by phairland for &lt;p&gt;I am able to switch workspaces with mod and a number key, but it does not work with the numeric pad.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3053/how-do-i-change-workspace-with-the-numeric-pad/?answer=3057#post-id-3057</link><description>You need to use the keycodes for the numeric pad. You can find out by the following command

    xbindkeys -k

and then press the key you need to find out the keycode.

For i3 you need to use bindcode instead of bindsym. The following code works on my system:
    
    bindcode $mod+87 workspace 1
    bindcode $mod+88 workspace 2
    bindcode $mod+89 workspace 3
    bindcode $mod+83 workspace 4
    bindcode $mod+84 workspace 5
    bindcode $mod+85 workspace 6
    bindcode $mod+79 workspace 7
    bindcode $mod+80 workspace 8
    bindcode $mod+81 workspace 9
    bindcode $mod+90 workspace 10
