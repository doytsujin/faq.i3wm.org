After I swap C and B for the second time, I should have `[A | [B | C] ]` according to you. But if I focus window B or C at that point and focus the parent container, I see all three windows are in the same (and only) container.</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:23:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3399/move-window-within-container/?comment=5128#comment-5128</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Assume I have the following layout&lt;/p&gt;

Are you using the latest version of i3? The following parts of your config could be helpful, too: `workspace_layout`, `default_orientation`, anything with `move [left|right|up|down]` or `layout`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 09:39:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3399/move-window-within-container/?comment=3400#comment-3400</guid></item></channel></rss>
