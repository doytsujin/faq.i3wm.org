i named my first 6 Desktops.
But if i open programms on them or just open these Desktops, they open

You have to prefix the workspace name with number to keep them orderded (as explained in the mentioned userguide section).

So in your case "1:work" instead of "work". And you may want to do this even for 'move workspace' commands otherwise moving window to nonexisting workspace will move window to workspace "1" instead of "1:work".</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 13:37:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/864/how-to-fix-desktop-order/?answer=867#post-id-867</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Kretortex for &lt;p&gt;Maybe I was not clear enough. &lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/864/how-to-fix-desktop-order/?answer=865#post-id-865</link><description>Which version are you running? And how exactly are your workspaces named?

This was itroduced quite time ago and it should work.

See [named workspaces](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_named_workspaces) in userguide for more details.  </description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 01:17:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/864/how-to-fix-desktop-order/?answer=865#post-id-865</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Kretortex for &lt;p&gt;Hey,

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/864/how-to-fix-desktop-order/?comment=891#comment-891</link><description>Nope. Names are sorted alphabetically (I think). So this is your only solution. It doesn't need to look ugly. For example I've set mine to "1: Chat". You can add spaces as long as you surround the name with quotation marks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:33:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/864/how-to-fix-desktop-order/?comment=891#comment-891</guid></item></channel></rss>
