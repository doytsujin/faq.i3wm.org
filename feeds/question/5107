Since it seems moving a container to the scratchpad always implies it being automatically resized and ripositioned to the center of the screen, I've found here in this site this workaroud.

    # Open a terminal during startup and move it to the scratchpad
    exec --no-startup-id urxvt -name urxvt_scratchpad
    for_window [instance="urxvt_scratchpad"] move scratchpad
    
    # Workaround to resize and reposition urxvt container
    for_window [instance="urxvt_scratchpad"] scratchpad show; move position 1000px 200px; move scratchpad

The problems I have are: 

1) I don't know how to resize the window to a custom value. (I want the terminal to be a small window for quick commands while browsing, etc)

2) I don't know how to set the exact position I want it to be, the above config example was just a test.

Using the mouse I can position the terminal in the place and with the size I'd like it to have, I'd only like to automatize this behaviour at startup.

Maybe there's a way to query i3 with the position of the terminal in the scratchpad and just copy&amp;paste it to the config?

    # Open a small terminal at startup
    exec --no-startup-id urxvt -name urxvt_scratchpad --geometry 70x15

    # Workaround size&amp;position
    for_window [instance="urxvt_scratchpad"] floating enable; move scratchpad; scratchpad show; move position 865px 512px; move scratchpad

Note: This was done on urxvt with this line specifying a custom font and pixelsize in the .Xdefaults file -&gt;

  # Font

URxvt*font: xft:Source Code Pro:pixelsize=11:style=regular

Different font and pixelsize may cause the terminal to be in a slightly different position than bottom left just over the status bar, the one I was looking for.
