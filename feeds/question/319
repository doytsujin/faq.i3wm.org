 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/319/after-upgrading-i3-i-see-error-messages-when-accidentally-pressing-keybinding-x/?answer=320#post-id-320</link><description>Since commit http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit/?h=next&amp;id=cc7f16007a21a3e105d6b093be615a574e0d486c, i3 will report errors in any keybinding. This deals with a very common case of mistakes, such as people configuring `bindsym Mod1+x firefox` instead of `bindsym Mod1+x exec firefox` or having typos in configured commands.

To disable error reporting for a particular binding, change it from this:

    bindsym Mod1+x move absolute position center

to this:

    bindsym Mod1+x exec --no-startup-id i3-msg move absolute position center &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

This will send the command to i3 using the IPC interface and redirect any errors (or output) to `/dev/null`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 06:39:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/319/after-upgrading-i3-i-see-error-messages-when-accidentally-pressing-keybinding-x/?answer=320#post-id-320</guid></item></channel></rss>
