it's just to have some reviews of your hangouts (chat from Google) use.
I, personnaly, am a very big fan of i3 which I use for one year now without finding a better WM but a point is very displeasing, it is the use of hangouts :
I have to put the chats boxes on a reserved workspace everytime a new conversation starts and pops in the middle of my others windows. Or passing them from tilled to floated windows and manage them isn't very comfortable and does not fix the problem of new conversations.
Also, in fullscreen they are very, very in unpleasant position...

 I can't find a way to use them correctly. I know that i3 is a tilling's manager, but for hangouts, it would be great to use them like in any other WM. Just attached at the bottom of the Google Chrome's browser.

Some of you have already found their way to use them correctly.

Please share your configurations, screenshots or opinions. Thx to you and thx to i3 to exists</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2014 20:31:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3559/the-use-of-hangouts/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, with 2 split windows, focus the parent ($mod+a by default) and make it float. You'll have to script that with `i3-msg`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2014 22:45:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3559/the-use-of-hangouts/?comment=3564#comment-3564</guid></item><item><title>Comment by exhuma for &lt;p&gt;Hi tinh,&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3559/the-use-of-hangouts/?answer=4935#post-id-4935</link><description>Although this is a really old question I wanted to provide the solution I applied to force the **Google Chrome Hangout Plugin** to be displayed on a specific workspace of mine. After investigating the window properties with *xprop* I found only two really useful properties which were

 - WM_NAME = "Hangouts"
 - WM_WINDOW_ROLE = "pop-up"

so I transformed these properties to the following i3 *for_window* configuration

    for_window [title="Hangouts"] move container to workspace 4
    fow_window [role="pop-up"] floating enabled


This will enable *floating* on all Windows being of role "pop-up" and move the window having *hangouts* as title to workspace 4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 21:44:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3559/the-use-of-hangouts/?answer=4935#post-id-4935</guid></item></channel></rss>
