However, that question seems to address only the part about directly switching to a workspace, not moving a container to a workspace.

I frequently rename my workspaces in an ad-hoc manner to easily see the names of the programs running in each workspace (and know where to switch). E.g. I have names like: "1: web, 2: code, 3: dbvis, 4: email" etc. These friendly names are prefixed with a number so that bindings like the following: 

    # switch to workspace
    bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1
    bindsym $mod+2 workspace number 2
    bindsym $mod+3 workspace number 3

... do in fact work. What doesn't work however is bindings for the `move container to workspace` commands. E.g. the following don't work:

    # move focused container to workspace
    bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace 1
    bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace 2
    bindsym $mod+Shift+3 move container to workspace 3

Instead, when I press `$mod+Shift+1` a new workspace named "1" is created (alongside the already existing workspace 
"1: web") and the window is moved there.

    # move focused container to workspace

Note that `$mod+Shift+2` will both move container to workspace 2 and go to workspace 2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2015 14:42:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7740/friendly-names-to-workspaces-dont-work-with-move-container/?answer=7744#post-id-7744</guid></item><item><title>Comment by basletic for &lt;p&gt;This works as expected:&lt;/p&gt;
