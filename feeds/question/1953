If there's nothing built into i3 right now, is anybody maybe achieving this with some external tools?</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 10:19:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1953/give-i3-a-zen-mode/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;It'd be nice if i3 had a keybinding to toggle zen mode - which is to hide/disable a defined list of distracting workspaces: e-mail, messenger or whatnot.

Ikraav, you could bind the key with a script instead that would toggle the i3bar and do additional stuff such as turn off notifiers, etc (in some cases you will need to really terminate applications,  like chrome, which doesn't use the system defaults).</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2013 14:08:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1953/give-i3-a-zen-mode/?comment=1979#comment-1979</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;A simple and pragmatic approach to this is to just hide your i3bar, which you can do in the latest development version even without reconfiguring anything.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1953/give-i3-a-zen-mode/?comment=1974#comment-1974</link><description>Indeed, I looked at the commit earlier and it's definitely a welcome addition. I still think the feature proposed in this question remains desireable. I have i3bar in mode = hide already and that's great, but still needs that missing piece. I'll see if I can come up with a patch.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2013 10:16:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1953/give-i3-a-zen-mode/?comment=1974#comment-1974</guid></item></channel></rss>
