If I `rm -rf ~/.purple`, it will start normally again, so I assume it saves some data which messes things up. However, this also deletes all my accounts and settings.

I tried auto-floating pidgin (`for_window [class="(?i)pidgin"] floating enable`), but this has no effect on the problem (though it does float then)

So I guess I'll have to take this somewhere else.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 16:01:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5014/pidgin-only-works-once/?comment=5027#comment-5027</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I can start &lt;code&gt;pidgin&lt;/code&gt; exactly once such that it works, but subsequent times it starts but its window is just nowhere to be found.

Just to see if it is an actual i3 problem or if there is something wrong with your pidgin.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 09:48:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5014/pidgin-only-works-once/?comment=5021#comment-5021</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;I can start &lt;code&gt;pidgin&lt;/code&gt; exactly once such that it works, but subsequent times it starts but its window is just nowhere to be found.

See comment #6 for a fix. Note that it doesn't just display a systray icon allowing you to bring the window back, but *actually* causes the window to not be invisible in the first place.
