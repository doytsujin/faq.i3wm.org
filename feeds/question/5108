A message saying it had crashed. A small rectangle in the middle of the screen with the message, from where I couldn't move the mouse away. It said to press r, b, c to restart i3 or do other stuff, but nothing worked. I rebooted. After that, I can't see the i3bar on the bottom of the screen. I tried yum-reinstalling i3 and it doesn't work. The i3bar and i3status processes are running.
Anyone has any ideas what might be going on?</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 16:50:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5108/i3bar-disappeared/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;I was browsing when I got, for the first time, an i3 error.
