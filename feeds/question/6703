You can just install both, lightdm should pick up both and you can select during login which one you want to use.</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2015 11:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6703/how-to-use-i3wm-with-gnome/?comment=6704#comment-6704</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dllkevin for &lt;p&gt;Hi

If it doesn't, it's not much of a desktop manager. However, the i3.desktop file has to be installed in the correct location (which should be the case).</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 12:02:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6703/how-to-use-i3wm-with-gnome/?comment=6736#comment-6736</guid></item></channel></rss>
