For example, I have the following line in my `i3` configuration file:

    for_window [class="Xfce4-notifyd"] floating enable
When I manually send notifications to the daemon via `notify-send`, they appear in the upper right corner of the active workspace. However, certain applications (in my case, Amarok and Guayadeque) send notifications to the center of the workspace. This is inconvenient as the messages persist for a while unless clicked. I would like to uniformly have all floating windows of this class be moved to the upper right corner of the current workspace. Can this be done in the `i3` configuration file or is the problem somehow application-specific?</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2014 20:20:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3926/configure-floating-window-location/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by phairland for &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to automatically send a floating window to a particular location?
