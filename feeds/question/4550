 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4550/launch-in-floating-mode/?answer=4551#post-id-4551</link><description>You could define a rule for your applications (e.g keepassx) like this:

    for_window [class="Keepassx"] floating enable

Note the capitol 'K' which is necessary as the rules are case sensitive.  
with `xprop` you can find out the class and instance of any program you would like to define a rule for. </description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2014 10:51:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4550/launch-in-floating-mode/?answer=4551#post-id-4551</guid></item><item><title>Comment by cee for &lt;p&gt;You could define a rule for your applications (e.g keepassx) like this:&lt;/p&gt;

It is not exactly what I wanted (since I hoped there was a way to have it only floated when called by my shortcut), but its good enough for me. Might not work for other purposes, though.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 11:43:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4550/launch-in-floating-mode/?comment=4563#comment-4563</guid></item><item><title>Comment by x3nu for &lt;p&gt;You could define a rule for your applications (e.g keepassx) like this:&lt;/p&gt;

have a schortcut to launch a terminal normaly as a tiled window
And have another shortcut to open it as a floating window:
Since i'm completly new to i3 a simply solution as: bindsym $mod+shift+enter exec xterm inFloatingMode would be nice</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 16:12:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4550/launch-in-floating-mode/?comment=5849#comment-5849</guid></item></channel></rss>
