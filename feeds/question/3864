</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3864/configure-global-menu/?comment=5007#comment-5007</link><description>is this something that could possibly be implemented in i3? I found it surprisingly helpful in saving screen real-estate. I wonder if something like http://www.webupd8.org/2015/02/use-global-menu-in-xubuntu-or-linux.html could be used with i3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 04:28:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3864/configure-global-menu/?comment=5007#comment-5007</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joelmo for &lt;p&gt;The integration of application menu bars into the bar at the top of the screen is a Unity-only feature.&lt;/p&gt;
