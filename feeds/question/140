I'm a new user of i3 on ubuntu precise, and i've been enjoying tiling wm.
But i would like to integrate gnome3 and it's bar, like for quick wireless configuration. I still want i3 to manage my windows.
Do you know how to do it ? For the moment, i've been chosing the "i3" entry that showed up in lightdm (Ubuntu's session manager) after the installation, but it doesnt run gnome3. I've done what is written here but no new entry showed up : http://askubuntu.com/questions/26115/i3-wm-with-auto-internet-connectivity-and-a-gnome-panel. (i rebooted).

It's not for Ubuntu, but one can adapt it easily. The Arch Linux Tarball also contains a combination of xsession, gnome-session and i3 .desktop files that start gnome 3 with i3 as window manager and the gnome panel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 10:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/140/i3-gnome3-on-ubuntu-precise/?answer=506#post-id-506</guid></item><item><title>Answer by TheQueasle for &lt;p&gt;Hello,

If you ignore the top parts about Fedora and skip to the last section, it may help you out.  (Haven't tested it on an Ubuntu box yet, but it should be essentially the same if you are using gnome 3)

It doesn't have the 'panels' like gnome shell, gnome-fallback, or unity, but it did help me out.  Main reason I did it was so I didn't have to enter my ssh key password every time I used it.

Hope this helps!

But basically, the default (try to use the latest available instead of the one in the Ubuntu repository, which is older version) already displays a bar in the bottom (called i3bar), and special configuration can be done to customize it. It also supports icons from a variety of programs such as pidgin, network manager (called nm-applet), etc. So, you don't need to run the gnome-session to be able to use "tray-icons".

So, for your case, you just start nm-applet (I have it started in my config script) and you should be able to handle it as usual. If it happens you can not see the icon (just a blank space on the right corner of the i3bar), it is a known issue, and discussed here:

This is an example of the tray icons from my computer now:

I'm not looking for a way to use ubuntu "magic" features with i3, I'm looking for a way to run gnome 3 under i3 like I could do with other wm's like fluxbox, and then use gnome 3 's pannels.
