I just noticed KeePassX (the only QT app I use) is all black. I can't see any graphics, only test is white. It's hard to navigate. Do I need to setup QT or something?</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2012 07:40:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/434/all-qt-apps-all-black/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sycamorex for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Have you tried temporarily removing .Xresources and .Xdefaults to see if that makes any difference?</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2012 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/434/all-qt-apps-all-black/?comment=436#comment-436</guid></item><item><title>Comment by acgtyrant for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Qt apps normally just work out of the box without any setup.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 23:19:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/434/all-qt-apps-all-black/?answer=449#post-id-449</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lzap for &lt;p&gt;What sycamorex commented.

I changed manually colors and now I can see the buttons, but the textfield background is still black. I am going to leave it for now.

Loads of black programs, guess I installed to minimal and need somehow to add a theme.

@lzap did you come up with any solution to this?</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2013 07:29:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/434/all-qt-apps-all-black/?answer=1970#post-id-1970</guid></item></channel></rss>
