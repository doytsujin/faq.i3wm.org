The issue that your screen gets smaller and smaller with each new window is really annoying. Having the titlebars (capped to N characters) on the left/right would be awesome, and your screen size would remain constant.

However, why don't you just use tabbed layout? It doesn't take up more space and does truncating. </description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 20:28:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6780/stacked-layout-titlebars-on-the-left/?answer=6781#post-id-6781</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;No, this isn't possible and I very much doubt Michael would accept this feature, though you can always try and submit a feature request on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6780/stacked-layout-titlebars-on-the-left/?comment=6786#comment-6786</link><description>Fair enough. Unfortunately as I said it's not possible and I really really doubt we would go for implementing this. Display text in a vertical bar is pretty awkward anyway, we had similar discussions for i3bar already.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 23:10:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6780/stacked-layout-titlebars-on-the-left/?comment=6786#comment-6786</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;No, this isn't possible and I very much doubt Michael would accept this feature, though you can always try and submit a feature request on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6780/stacked-layout-titlebars-on-the-left/?comment=6785#comment-6785</link><description>I use the tabbed mode, but I find easier on my eyes having all the text grouped like in stacked mode, where I easily see the order of my windows like a paragraph, while also finding it annoying that my screen gets reduced everytime.

Dynamically changing my screen size is madness!</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 22:58:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6780/stacked-layout-titlebars-on-the-left/?comment=6785#comment-6785</guid></item></channel></rss>
