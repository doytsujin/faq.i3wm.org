I've got a question about getting the latest version of i3 in Debian Stable. i3 Homepage says:

&gt; **You are using Debian stable**
&gt; 
&gt; The latest version of i3 will be in
&gt; Debian testing quite soon. The version
&gt; in Debian stable can be old, however
&gt; (we cannot update it after stable has
&gt; been released). The best way is to add
&gt; Debian testing and tell apt to prefer
&gt; Debian stable. You should not use our
&gt; repository.

Now I was wondering what you exactly mean with "The best way is to add Debian testing and tell apt to prefer Debian stable"?
I'm fairly new to Debian and if that's a dumb question I'm really sorry about that, but I just don't get it.
Does it mean I should add backports? That I'd understand but why should I tell apt to use stable then? How do I do that anyway?

Again sorry if I'm just being dumb - any kind of help would be highly appreciated, thanks alot.

Until wheezy is released, you can use my repository which contains the released version of i3 for stable and testing as well as the supported Ubuntu releases.

You can follow the instructions for stable Ubuntu packages on 
[i3: Debian and Ubuntu repositories](http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html), Section 2.1 but replacing "universe" with "main":

    # echo "deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ $(lsb_release -c -s) universe" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install sur5r-keyring
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install i3</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 11:16:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1563/latest-i3-version-in-debian-stable/?answer=1566#post-id-1566</guid></item><item><title>Comment by AJ for &lt;p&gt;As Debian is currently in freeze, new versions tend to show up in experimental only.
