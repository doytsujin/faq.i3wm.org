Is it possible to switch a parent container from vertical to horizontal layout (and vice versa) ? I struggle sometimes to make a H container with 3 terminals in the bottom of the screen to be a V container and on the left or right of the screen.

Cheers,

    layout splitv

or

    layout splith

for vertical/horizontal split, respectively.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 15:08:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1490/is-it-possible-to-dynamically-switch-a-container-layout-type/?answer=1491#post-id-1491</guid></item><item><title>Answer by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Dear i3 community,&lt;/p&gt;

I think I have the same problem of changing from three windows in a row to a layout with one window on the left and the remaining two one below the other on the right side. I can only achieve this in the following way:

1) switching the middle container to vertical layout
2) moving the right window to a different workspace
3) directly moving it back to the original one

If instead of 2) and 3) I try to move the right window down using $mod+Downarrow the window move down, but spreads over the entire width of the workspace. Do I do something from, is this by design or is it a bug?</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 12:02:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1490/is-it-possible-to-dynamically-switch-a-container-layout-type/?answer=1500#post-id-1500</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/users/1/michael/"&gt;@Michael&lt;/a&gt;: Sorry to put this as an answer but 250 characters is not enough ;-) Are you sure your answer solves the issue?
