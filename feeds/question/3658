I have been using i3 for a while and I like its simplicity.
I'm not a programmer nevertheless I like it. Just a suggestion:
I hope that the developers would keep non-developers or
programmers in mind when programming this wm.

My question: There seems to a problem with blinking of the
workspaces in the bar for single instance apps like smplayer.
Whenever I hit a custom defined key for the player, the workspace
containing it would not blink. Since this a single instance app
another instance would not start and the instance already running
is not indicated by the workspace containing it. But when I hit
the key in the workspace which contains it then smplayer gets
focused. This is not the case with programs like firefox which
allow multiple instances. 

Another point I would like to make is that when I select open folder
(for a torrent) in transmission-gtk, It opens the fm (in my case pcmanfm)
and workspace blinks but when the fm is already opened then there
is no indication but the folder opens in a new tab. This also
happens when opening an url in a new tab in already running firefox
contained in a different workspace from an email client (like geary).

It would be great if workspaces could blink in cases such as these.
(My computer is running ArchLinux, i3 4.7, Firefox 28, Smplayer 0.8.6)
Thanks in advance and Keep up the good work.

I recommend to create one ticket per suggestion at http://bugs.i3wm.org/. The best way to explain what you’re doing is to create a short video.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:25:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3658/blinking-of-workspaces-for-single-instance-programs-and-new-tabs-in-already-running-applications-like-pcmanfm-or-firefox/?comment=3662#comment-3662</guid></item></channel></rss>
