Can someone clarify how these three terms are related? For example:

 * Are workspaces related 1:1 with outputs (i.e. a workspace is on exactly one output at a time)?
 * Are "outputs" the same as "screens"?
 * When using two monitors, are there two workspaces visible simultaneously (one on each screen/output)?
