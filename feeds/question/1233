I just installed lubuntu 12.04, and replaced the window manager lxde uses (opebox) with i3. First of all, has anybody done that before? How was the experience? For me, so far so good. lxde doesn't seem to require much from the window manager, so there aren't any incompatibilities and everything seems to work smoothly. I only have a couple of problems.

Problem number one: some shortcuts don't work. Specifically the $mod + shift + (1|2|3|...) ones. I'm guessing lxde defines some shortcuts on its own, and the one that don't work are already taken. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to "unbind" them. Can anyone help? I tried lxshortcuts, but the program is broken in lubuntu 12.04.

Problem number two: the applet for showing workspaces in the lxpanel doesn't support i3, hence it doesn't work. Does anybody know a nice applet fro that?

I've got to say, I like the result a lot. It has all the convenience of a desktop environment out of the box, plus the convenience of i3.

Thanks for the time, bye</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2013 18:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1233/lxde-and-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by smiszym for &lt;p&gt;Hello folk,&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to use workspaces in i3, you should use switcher compatible with i3 (I use the default, placed on i3bar).</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2013 14:41:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1233/lxde-and-i3/?comment=2120#comment-2120</guid></item><item><title>Comment by smiszym for &lt;p&gt;Hello folk,&lt;/p&gt;

This would seem to allow you to avoid loading any conflicting sets of instructions between the two display managers. I think that might eliminate the problems you're seeing.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 23:34:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1233/lxde-and-i3/?answer=5466#post-id-5466</guid></item></channel></rss>
