I have an Ubuntu 12.04 install running inside Virtualbox on my ThinkPad. I have a trusty Linux desktop PC which runs a Synergy server talking to a Synergy client on my Thinkpad. I like to drive i3wm from the desktop PC keyboard with the ThinkPad display on the desktop PC monitor.

**Disaster!** The Win key sent by Synergy is consumed by Windows before it reaches i3wm so most of my mod4 keybindings conflict with Windows short cuts. What to do?

The **xcape** program lets me send a key when I press Shift alone, otherwise Shift works as normal. I modified i3wm config using modes (think ctrl-x in emacs) such that to type Win+X I hit Shift then X. As icing on the cake I disabled the left Win key with xmodmap. Thus I can forget Windows is there when I run i3wm.
