Trying to get output from older Acer sub notebook laptop using a 3rd party (china device) USB to HDMI converter - model FY1327 to behave correctly. I have installed libdlo-0.1.2 as per download. Tested okay on completion, However still no proper output via Knoppix.  

Use of aRandR shows it supports only local laptop monitor 4.5" x 7.75" called LVDS1 and VGA1 which is an external 19" Acer VGA panel monitor.  I am not able to drive a 3rd monitor [TV]  via HDMI  using the USB to HDMI accessory when plugged into laptop.

I believe I need to install xRandR, to control extra monitors ..  How do I do this.

Thanks. </description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 19:41:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6394/trying-to-install-driver-support-in-knoppix-75-for-hdmi-output-lvds1-vga1/</guid></item></channel></rss>
