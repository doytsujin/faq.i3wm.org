I would like to find a way to lock my session and let a friend use his account.

So all my workspaces and stuff would stay unchanged, I'd would be kinda disconnected, but actually not, and my friend could enter his user/pass and choose is Session (i3, xfce, whatever).

Exactly what we could find under gnome or any other DM. 

I'm under Debian Jessie (testing), use i3 from the debian repos, and use Slim as Display Manager or Login Manager.

I tried to start i3 from another tty but got a "Cannot open display" :)

Thanks !</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 17:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2634/switch-user/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi !&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for that answer, I actually tried it before and got a "command not found". After your answer I apt-cache search-ed startx and installed xinit for it to work.

Cheers !

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2634/switch-user/?answer=3797#post-id-3797</link><description>I also tried to do it with SLiM but to no avail. With MDM or GDM you could use `mdmflexiserver` or `gdmflexiserver` (with potential `--new` switch) to switch users. If jumping to another login manager is no option for you then only a new X server would do it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 20:37:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2634/switch-user/?answer=3797#post-id-3797</guid></item></channel></rss>
