But, as far as my experience goes, you could adjust the screen to fit your monitor...</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2012 12:39:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/273/how-to-accomplish-simple-panning-capability-for-large-windows/?comment=287#comment-287</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;I have a large VNC screen configured on the server which I'm viewing on a smaller resolution laptop.

This panning capability is not limited to this particular VNC app.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2012 22:48:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/273/how-to-accomplish-simple-panning-capability-for-large-windows/?comment=302#comment-302</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have a large VNC screen configured on the server which I'm viewing on a smaller resolution laptop.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/273/how-to-accomplish-simple-panning-capability-for-large-windows/?answer=359#post-id-359</link><description>I don’t really see how this could be considered a window manager issue. Panning window contents in the window manager decoration is most likely accompanied by many side-effects and a work-around for a problem which should be solved in the application.

Therefore, I won’t implement or merge such a feature into i3. As to your original question: Not sure if Xorg allows for this in some way.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 13:18:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/273/how-to-accomplish-simple-panning-capability-for-large-windows/?answer=359#post-id-359</guid></item></channel></rss>
