I've only been on i3 for a couple of weeks and am loving it... have even turned a couple of friends onto it too! So thanks!

One frustrating issue tho... When I hit resize (mod+r) the workspace "resize" appears but none of the resizing keys work. The screen flickers but nothing moves. Dragging with the mouse does nothing either. My resize is the default config.

I am using i3 4.7.2-1 on Arch.

Any help gratefully appreciated.


update: ok... of course as soon as I posted I realised my mistake... I thought i could resize in all modes, not just floating. And i hadn't tried floating... which proves to work!

Please consider opening a bug report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 15:05:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3893/resize-doesnt-work/?comment=3905#comment-3905</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

In i3 tiled windows always take up the whole screen. Resizing just moves the border between two windows/containers, but the screen borders stay fixed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 08:34:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3893/resize-doesnt-work/?comment=3911#comment-3911</guid></item></channel></rss>
