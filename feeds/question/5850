Maybe increasing its priority/niceness, or having them always on RAM or some other smart way? 

I doubt it would waste much resources and would improve my experience, which pretty often involves waiting a couple of seconds after pressing those things. This also disallows me to just press the keys without thinking in order to get some program started or switch to some workspace, because whatever I type before those programs open gets dropped.

It literally just opens a small window, even without any heavy GUI toolkit, but basic XCB.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5850/making-i3-input-dmenu_run-faster/?comment=5855#comment-5855</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to make those open faster?

Usually i3-input takes a second or two the first time if I hadn't used it in several minutes, but its fast if I run it again just afterwards.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:47:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5850/making-i3-input-dmenu_run-faster/?comment=5853#comment-5853</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to make those open faster?

I think if you hit hardware limits, you should reduce the usage of other things or invest in more hardware. You generally shouldn't have to max out RAM in a machine. Just my 2c, though. Good luck :)</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:51:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5850/making-i3-input-dmenu_run-faster/?comment=5856#comment-5856</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to make those open faster?

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5850/making-i3-input-dmenu_run-faster/?comment=5857#comment-5857</link><description>@airblader then perhaps preloading plus some way of telling the kernel "don't you dare move this small thing to swap". I plan on a new machine but it's not always so easy :). I'd get more RAM without changing the machine if it wasn't more than twice as expensive as the newer RAM. Thanks for the 2c!</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5850/making-i3-input-dmenu_run-faster/?comment=5857#comment-5857</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to make those open faster?
