Thanks a lot for i3!
I just cloned the sources. I've got revision: 4.6-41-g04847ee. I've built it from sources; and am using this as my i3 on Ubuntu 13.10.
I wanted to begin my exploration by running tests.

some tests fail for me:

Use “next” instead of “master” for development. Ask on IRC or report a bug for help with problems, the FAQ is not suitable for that.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2013 19:04:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2644/failed-test-urgent/?comment=2646#comment-2646</guid></item></channel></rss>
