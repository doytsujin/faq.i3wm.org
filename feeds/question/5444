Basically I want to use only one tray -- either i3s or KDEs tray, but not both. Currently for some reason desktops are showing up in i3 tray, but applications are placed on Plasma's. Any ideas how do I remove one of them and let the other one handle all the things.

It doesn't matter which one that last one will be, I'm happy with either way. E.g. Plasma panel that shows i3 desktops or i3 panel that has the tray.

Thanks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 22:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5444/using-only-one-paneltray-when-using-i3-with-kde/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I recently started using i3 with KDE to let KDE handle all the boring details, but now I can't make the tray working as I wanted.

You can hide the entire bar, or just the system tray---whichever you'd like. Or you can remove the Plasma panel from KDE.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2015 21:23:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5444/using-only-one-paneltray-when-using-i3-with-kde/?answer=5446#post-id-5446</guid></item></channel></rss>
