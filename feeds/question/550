I'm using i3 for several months and I still feel some things are missing : mainly the possibility to manipulate windows with the mouse. I mean :
&lt;ul&gt;closing windows (e.g. with a little cross-button on the title bar like many other wm, or by clicking with some button on the titlebar)&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;switching to full screen (e.g. with double-click on the titlebar)&lt;/ul&gt;

So I would like to know whether options to handle this will be implemented in the future, or if there's some way to configure this by hand.

Thanks, and thanks for developing such a great wm.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 19:38:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=551#post-id-551</link><description>No, features like little close buttons will not be implemented. i3 does not have full mouse support (or traditional mouse support) as one of its goals.

What still has a chance of getting introduced is bindsym-like support for mouse-buttons, e.g. that you can bind what a click on a window title with each mouse button should do. But nothing apart from that is planned (or desirable IMO) with regards to mouse support.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 19:46:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=551#post-id-551</guid></item><item><title>Answer by hos for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=5573#post-id-5573</link><description>Apparently bindsym features for mouse buttons have been added in the 4.9 release. 

    # The middle button over a titlebar kills the window
    bindsym --release button2 kill
    
    # The middle button and a modifer over any part of the window kills the window
    bindsym --whole-window $mod+button2 kill
    
    # The right button toggles floating
    bindsym button3 floating toggle
    bindsym $mod+button3 floating toggle
    
    # The side buttons move the window around
    bindsym button9 move left
    bindsym button8 move right

Visit [mousebindings section in the User's Guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#mousebindings) for the necessary configuration. </description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 18:06:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=5573#post-id-5573</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Timbus for &lt;p&gt;Hi,

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=1252#post-id-1252</link><description>Hi there. I added this to i3 quite some time ago and could not live without it:

    diff --git a/src/click.c b/src/click.c
    index 3022c24..e76a57c 100644
    --- a/src/click.c
    +++ b/src/click.c

         }
     
    +    if (dest == CLICK_DECORATION &amp;&amp; event-&gt;detail == 2) {

It allows windows to be closed with middle-click. If you have the latest git pull of the 'next' branch you should be able to apply it.

If anyone finds it useful, I might work on adding more mouse support such as moving and swapping window positions..</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2013 01:41:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/550/manipulating-windows-with-the-mouse/?answer=1252#post-id-1252</guid></item><item><title>Comment by dev-zero for &lt;p&gt;Hi there.
