I am thinking of adding the i3 repository for Trusty, but I would like first to ask if the i3 version in that repository is considered "stable" (in relation to be used with Trusty) or is mostly for people who want "the latest and greatest".

Predefined workspaces was a lifesaver for me, but the stability of my main workstation is more important.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 18:53:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4646/ubuntu-repository-stability/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I was using debian testing but I have switched to Ubuntu 14.04.

Just give it a try, we certainly consider it stable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 06:00:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4646/ubuntu-repository-stability/?answer=4648#post-id-4648</guid></item></channel></rss>
