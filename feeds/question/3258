 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3258/i3bar-system-trayicon-disappeared/?answer=3259#post-id-3259</link><description>i3bar is now a little more strict when it comes to the `tray_output` directive within the bar config block. If you specify an output that bar isn't on, the tray will not initialize. Check your bar config for that directive and make sure the output really exists (check for a trailing space). The old behavior was to initialize the tray on the first output it could find.

You can resolve this issue by simply removing that line from your bar config.

This was originally intended to make configuring multiple bars easier.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:24:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3258/i3bar-system-trayicon-disappeared/?answer=3259#post-id-3259</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;i3bar is now a little more strict when it comes to the &lt;code&gt;tray_output&lt;/code&gt; directive within the bar config block.

But I see your point, and I think this will most likely be changed in the next version.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 11:54:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3258/i3bar-system-trayicon-disappeared/?comment=3262#comment-3262</guid></item><item><title>Comment by helsinki for &lt;p&gt;i3bar is now a little more strict when it comes to the &lt;code&gt;tray_output&lt;/code&gt; directive within the bar config block.

That is a bug in i3 that has been fixed. The fix will be available in an upcoming patch release (4.7-2).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:29:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3258/i3bar-system-trayicon-disappeared/?comment=3260#comment-3260</guid></item></channel></rss>
