If you use i3status, you can put it in the general config there. If you use tools such as i3blocks, i3pystatus and the like, you have to add it there (see the tools' documentation).

The reason you are seeing three dots is because the separator is too long for the space it has and thus gets abbreviated to an ellipsis ("…"). Increasing `sep_block_width` will fix this.

I've submitted a PR (https://github.com/i3/i3/pull/1634) to provide a reasonable default right away, then you don't have to go through the awkward process of adjusting `sep_block_width`. If it gets merged, you'd have to wait for the next release, though (which probably won't be very long).
