When I log in the bottom left only shows the single box with a "1" in it. The other workspaces seem to be working, but I can't change my view to actually see any workspace but workspace 1.


Examples:
I can use mod+2 to move focus to workspace 2, but it doesn't actually change my view. It DOES make my current window lose focus, and causes the workspace "1" box to go gray out. I can then mod+1 to get back to workspace 1.

I can do other things like moving windows to and from other workspaces, and even create terminals in other workspaces and then move them to workspace 1. But I can't move my view.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 03:56:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3212/only-1-workspace-and-none-being-created/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I just installed i3 (4.7 from the i3 Ubuntu repository) on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 13.10, but I can't seem to get more than 1 workspace.

You can see what i3 thinks are the active outputs with ``i3-msg -t get_outputs``. If that does not help, please update your post with a description of your monitor setup, and your config. </description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 07:14:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3212/only-1-workspace-and-none-being-created/?answer=3213#post-id-3213</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;This is expected behaviour for &lt;em&gt;output 1&lt;/em&gt; if there is a second output.

Does your graphics card have anything else connected, or maybe a TV output?</description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2014 15:22:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3212/only-1-workspace-and-none-being-created/?comment=3277#comment-3277</guid></item></channel></rss>
