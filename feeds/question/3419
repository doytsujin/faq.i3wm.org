</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3419/where-to-put-nvidia-x-server-settings/?comment=3422#comment-3422</link><description>@Mori, the settings in the xorg.conf are loaded completely before a window manager is started. The difference in behaviour between i3 and Unity is, that Unity tries to do its own auto-configuration while i3 does not. Have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log if any errors are reported. </description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2014 08:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3419/where-to-put-nvidia-x-server-settings/?comment=3422#comment-3422</guid></item><item><title>Answer by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;The video settings in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file are not used when starting i3.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3419/where-to-put-nvidia-x-server-settings/?answer=3428#post-id-3428</link><description>This is ordinarily the job of the display manager (your login thing) so you will want to check the configuration options for whichever one you use.

You can see what files are being loaded from the X log file usually located at `/var/log/Xorg.0.log`. Check for the lines that look like this:

    [ 39103.247] (++) Using config file: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
    [ 39103.248] (==) Using config directory: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d"

Be sure to put your config files in the config directory with something like `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia-settings.conf`.

I don't think Ubuntu uses the standard path. It is more likely located at `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d`.

You can change the files that are loaded with arguments to Xorg. From `man xorg`:

    -config file
         Read  the  server  configuration  from file.  This option will
         work for any file when the server is run as  root  (i.e,  with
         real-uid  0), or for files relative to a directory in the con‚Äê
         fig search path for all other users.

     -configdir directory
         Read the server  configuration  files  from  directory.   This
         option  will  work for any directory when the server is run as
         root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for directories relative to  a
         directory  in  the  config directory search path for all other
         users.
