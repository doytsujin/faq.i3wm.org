I put this in my ~/.xinitrc, among other things:

    export KDEWM=/usr/bin/i3
    kdeinit5 # you should have this and other KDE binaries in the PATH
    startkde

As you may guessed, I don't have a graphical login manager and I start my session by issuing **startx**. However, that should also work with your graphical login manager.

Once in your KDE session, you can use kwallet or other KDE tools that use the classical QWidget-based UI. However, tools like the plasmoids, and the nm applet is a plasmoid, won't show. But it may be easily replaced with wicd - I use it and really love it, as it has a curses interface and it brings my wifi when still in text-mode login, before I start the graphical session.

The power settings may be altered by launching **systemsettings** and by navigating to the Power Management section.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 22:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6099/i3-with-kde-tools/?answer=6110#post-id-6110</guid></item></channel></rss>
