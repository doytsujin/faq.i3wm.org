I recently presented a slide deck made with LibreOffice.  Not sure if my workflow to have the slides on the external presenter (HDMI1) and the presenter notes on my Notebook's monitor (LVDS1) is optimal?  Precisely, I did the following steps:

 1. Had LO on a workspace on LVDS1, pressed F5 and got both the slides and the presenter notes as tiled windows
 1. Moved the slides to a workspace on HDMI1 
 1. Switched to fullscreen for the presenter notes
 1. Switched to fullscreen for the slides

Sure, that worked but is there an easier way to start a presentation?  A neat i3 config trick to have the slides in fullscreen on the external display and the presenter notes in fullscreen on the internal display?

Cheers and thanks,

Alternatively, dig in the LibreOffice settings. </description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 23:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2114/libreoffice-presentation-done-righttm-with-i3/?comment=4055#comment-4055</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

If you would like to automate these three extra steps, there are probably ways to do it. You could have a look with `xprop` if the presentation window matches some particular string, and make a `for_window`-rule in your config file. Good luck! </description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2013 13:32:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2114/libreoffice-presentation-done-righttm-with-i3/?answer=2118#post-id-2118</guid></item></channel></rss>
