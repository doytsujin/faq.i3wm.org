Using a command prompt in a terminal, I can start conky in my current workspace and using keystrokes I can send it to the workspace I want. I want to use a keystroke from a 'mode' or have it start on startup. I can't. I've tried the various suggestions -- they all worked until I plugged in conky ?
I do use conky in the status bar.
