In my case, this always takes me to the LAST vim instance rather than the NEXT vim instance. 

I would like to cycle between vim instances using a keybinding, is it possible to implement this with only config (no scripting)?

There is a script which focuses the next chrome instance on a workspace (which I believe is better than the “focus” command, which will just match any window AFAIR):
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3-egg/tree/examples/i3-next-chrome.scm

Maybe that can serve as a starting point/inspiration.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2013 00:05:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1222/focus-cycle-between-specific-windows/?answer=1224#post-id-1224</guid></item><item><title>Comment by muz for &lt;p&gt;No, cycling between windows is not possible without external scripting.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe somebody should edit the User's Guide to avoid misunderstandings, because it does sound like the cycling behavior is default.  </description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2013 00:10:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1222/focus-cycle-between-specific-windows/?comment=1226#comment-1226</guid></item></channel></rss>
