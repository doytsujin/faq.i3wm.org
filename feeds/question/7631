Or a floating window to open in a corner ?

I would like to replace use i3 to manage emacs directly so If I have shortcut to open new emacs horizontally or vertically it would be cool.

 Also I like to have a floating terminal on bottom right corner when I am coding so opening it directly into that corner would be great. I still could add `move right XXXpx; move down YYYpx` after the command, but I sometimes plug a dual screen with another resolution so values may changed.

I have no idea what you want to achieve.

You could probably use `xdotool` to write a script that moves the window to where you want it to be. `xrandr` should give you enough information about the current screen setup.</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 18:47:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7631/open-an-application-in-a-certain-position/?answer=7639#post-id-7639</guid></item><item><title>Comment by nscott32 for &lt;blockquote&gt;

And for my first question I meant having a keybind for an application that will always split it horizontally when in split mode, I hope it's clear.</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 21:29:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7631/open-an-application-in-a-certain-position/?comment=7643#comment-7643</guid></item></channel></rss>
