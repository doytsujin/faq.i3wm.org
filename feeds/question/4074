For example, when several windows are tabbed, it would be nice if I could chose how they are referred to.
Ideally, this could be done dynamically, but if not possible, I would also be interested in workarounds for specific applications. For example, some way to make all Firefox windows show up as "Firefox" (instead of the selected tab's title).
If this is not possible from i3 and it always shows some title property of the x window, anyone knows how one could change that property, or if it makes sense/is safe to do so?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4074/changing-window-title/?answer=4076#post-id-4076</link><description>Window titles are set by the applications not by *i3*. *i3* simply relays what is set in the `WM_NAME` or `_NET_WM_NAME` attributes. While it would be possible to patch *i3* to display something else (in fact *i3* uses part of `WM_CLASS` of windows for the titles of surrounding containers), I don't think it will be a configurable feature anytime soon.

That leaves modifying the title from inside the application. Most applications have no easy way to change their window titles. Fortunatelly, for Firefox there seem to be a few add-ons that may be useful. For example [customize_titlebar_v2](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/customize_titlebar_v2/?src=search), which seems to be able to do what you want (but I did not test it).

Terminal windows are also quite easy to do. Unless your shell already sets the title somewhere a simple `echo -e "\e]0;Your title here\a"` should do.
