It always depends on the programs that are currently running, some of which may be designed to grab keys globally (e.g. `xbindkey`, and also *i3* itself). Which keys are bound depends on the programs and can probably only be viewed in the respective configurations.


i3
--

*i3* grabs only the key bindings defined in its configuration file. *i3* takes the first - and only the first - file it finds from this list:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config` (defaults to `~/.config/i3/config` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset)
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3/config` (defaults to `/etc/xdg/i3/config` if `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` is unset)
3. `~/.i3/config`
4. `/etc/i3/config`

If your config file is `~/.config/i3/config`, running `grep -e '^[^#]*bind' ~/.config/i3/config` should get you a list of used bindings. 


X11
---

*X11* by default only binds **Ctrl+Alt+Fn** (with **Fn** being some function key) for switching to virtual consoles and **Shift+Insert** for pasting text from the clipboard.

 Unfortunatelly the case where other bindings may be defined is not as clear cut as with *i3*. Other bindings probably may be defined in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` or in files in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`. But Debian-based distributions also do some configuration in `/etc/defaults/keyboard`. Some distributions (used to?) define settings in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`. And some settings can also be altered with programs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2015 10:11:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5483/how-can-i-list-all-xorg-and-i3-keybindings-currently-in-effect/?answer=5492#post-id-5492</guid></item></channel></rss>
