For me, borders don't serve much purpose when there's only one window on the current workspace; however, it really is nothing more than a very minor cosmetic disturbance (less than 0.5% of the pixels).

I can't post links, but search on github for "i3 smart-border.patch" by user "0x2493"

Get the latest source from here:  git clone git://code.i3wm.org/i3

apply patch and make. might want to do it in a separate branch so you can easily merge upstream changes
