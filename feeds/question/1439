If this behavior is intended -- that workspace 1 and workspace number 1 are different -- I can use variables to solve my problem. If not, I'll send a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1439/accessing-named-workspaces-assigned-to-outputs-by-number/?comment=1442#comment-1442</guid></item><item><title>Answer by vandannen for &lt;p&gt;I have the following lines in my i3 config: &lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1439/accessing-named-workspaces-assigned-to-outputs-by-number/?answer=1441#post-id-1441</link><description>I can confirm this, but there is one exception: if a corresponding workspace, e.g. "1: mail", was created prior to issuing the command "workspace number 1", the command will focus the previously created workspace. So, this only seems to work for already existing workspaces, though I do not know whether this is intended.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 18:47:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1439/accessing-named-workspaces-assigned-to-outputs-by-number/?answer=1441#post-id-1441</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have the following lines in my i3 config: &lt;/p&gt;

    workspace number 1: mail

This will switch to workspace number 1, or create “1: mail” if no such workspace exists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:02:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1439/accessing-named-workspaces-assigned-to-outputs-by-number/?answer=1446#post-id-1446</guid></item></channel></rss>
