I start on the left most window.
I'd like to set  `Alt+Tab` to  focus on the next window to the right, then since we reach the end of the left monitor, switch to the right monitor, left most window, then the next, then since we reach the end of the right monitor, circle back to the left-most window on the left monitor.

I thought about doing it in a script using the return code of `focus right`, but since it circles, it always returns true.
Something like:

    if (!focus right) then  
      focus output right

That isn't to say an IPC script can't take care of it, though. 

By the way:

&gt; each containing 2 vertical splits

In "i3 speak" you are talking about a horizontal split, which is a split where two containers are side by side (left/right of each other).</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6114/focus-between-windows-on-current-output-then-switch-to-the-next/?answer=6115#post-id-6115</guid></item></channel></rss>
