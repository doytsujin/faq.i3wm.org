I have the strange habit of exiting the wm and shutting down from gdm...which is pretty dumb I suppose. I had issues (hangups on shutdown) when doing "halt" from a shell with ubuntu 12.04/awesome...shutting down from gdm seemed to clear that.

I know, this thread is old, but I found a good solution for me.
In ~/.i3/config I changed the bindsym of exiting to 

    bindsym $mod+Shift+e exec i3-msg exit

That way, it chooses the "Yes, exit i3" path automatically.
