As for KeePass, when I try to type my master password, symbols that require Ctrl+Alt or AltGr to be pressed (for example AltGr+2 for "@" on my Swedish keyboard) just don't work, so I can't type my password correctly.

These are the lines in my i3-config:

    assign [class="KeePass2"] 2
    exec --no-startup-id keepass

Works fine when launching KeePass manually afterwards. I guess it has something to do with some environment variables not being available when i3 executes my exec commands, but I have no idea how to solve this.

For instance, the tray icon will not work with the Mono version. I would suggest trying the X version and if that does not work, file a bug report.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 23:25:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3585/autostarting-keepass-causes-weird-keyboard-behaviour/?comment=3587#comment-3587</guid></item><item><title>Comment by simendsjo for &lt;p&gt;I don't know if this applies to other Mono applications as well, but when I start KeePass through my i3-config, some key combinations stop working for that application.

It's even worse when using programmer dvorak. I cannot even use numbers. I had to change my master password from windows to be able to log in. I use it with a lot of copy/paste when needed...</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 09:52:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3585/autostarting-keepass-causes-weird-keyboard-behaviour/?comment=3605#comment-3605</guid></item></channel></rss>
