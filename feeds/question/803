If your connection doesn't work it's not i3 fault. You have to use network manager or wpa_supplicant and some network configuration utility. I don't know what crunchbang uses.

And if it works fine but you don't see wireless information in i3bar there are two things which can cause this. 

 - you don't have right interface name in i3status.conf
 - your kernel doesn't allow to configure your card via library i3status currently uses (see this question for more info: [question 218](http://faq.i3wm.org/question/218/is-i3status-compatible-with-wpa_supplicant/))

If you run iwconfig in termnial and it prints status of your wireless NIC then its probably the first case. Otherwise it's the second thing which is not easy to fix right now (as explained in mentioned thread).</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 15:49:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/803/no-wifi-in-i3/?answer=804#post-id-804</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jockster for &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what's your problem.
