 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/183/how-to-get-i3wm-font-anti-aliasing/?answer=194#post-id-194</link><description>There is a user package available for arch linux that includes a patch for pango support: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=59344

I previously extracted the patch by fernandotcl from the mailing list and patched it myself, but recently this package came along. I'm not sure whether that's the same patch.

To use Xft you have to set the font in the i3 config like this:

    font xft:Droid Sans Mono 10
