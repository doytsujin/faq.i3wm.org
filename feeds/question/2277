Here is the relevant part of my config:

    bar {
        output LVDS1
        output LVDS2
        tray_output primary
        status_command i3status
    }

    bar {
        output VGA1
        output VGA2
    }

If I switch off the LVDS output I'd like to see my status bar and tray icons (nm-applet) on VGA and switch them back if both monitors are active again. I tried i3-msg "bar { status_command i3status }", but did not succeed. Can this be achieved (4.5.1)?
