</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?comment=310#comment-310</link><description>True, but that would involve including background logic into i3 (copying the root window image). Or perhaps only into i3lock. In the first case I can't imagine it would get incorporated, while in the second perhaps its a possibility.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2012 14:59:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?comment=310#comment-310</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Wallpapers in X11 work by changing the root window contents.

This should be done in a separate program or script.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 12:02:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?comment=413#comment-413</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Atmoz for &lt;p&gt;Wallpapers in X11 work by changing the root window contents.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?comment=276#comment-276</link><description>The following tutorial for getting urxvt transparent says "[...] copies the wallpaper to the background of the terminal. (more exactly, the contents of Xorg's root window)": http://ctkarch.org/documentation/tutorials/tuto.php?page=urxvt-transpa.xml

So it sounds like it's not that impossible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2012 14:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?comment=276#comment-276</guid></item><item><title>Answer by sysadamin for &lt;p&gt;I want i3lock to show my current desktop wallpaper, without the need to set path manually every time I change the wallpaper.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?answer=411#post-id-411</link><description>you could use a screenshot, inside a wrapper around i3lock - something like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    scrot /tmp/screen_locked.png
    i3lock -i /tmp/screen_locked2.png

save the file as an executable somewhere in your path, and that should do it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 04:52:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?answer=411#post-id-411</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sysadamin for &lt;p&gt;you could use a screenshot, inside a wrapper around i3lock - something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?answer=1110#post-id-1110</link><description>This is what I did.  As stated above using a screenshot will work.  However, I did not want any activity on the scrot.  I just took a scrot of a good lock back ground image as my wallpaper, with no active apps, and saved it in the &lt;code&gt;.i3&lt;/code&gt; directory.  So when I call i3 lock 
&lt;pre&gt;
i3lock -i ~/.i3/lock_screen.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

I get a nice clean lock screen</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 13:45:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?answer=1110#post-id-1110</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lzap for &lt;p&gt;I want i3lock to show my current desktop wallpaper, without the need to set path manually every time I change the wallpaper.

Please note in Fedora the i3lock is not compiled with "-i" support, therefore you can't even load an image there.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 13:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/274/use-desktop-wallpaper-as-i3lock-image/?answer=420#post-id-420</guid></item></channel></rss>
