but my case was a bit more tricky, i have a "FN" key instead of windows key on the left side and that "FN" doesn't send a keycode. So i wired it to the windows key on the left side :D

Only possible with keyboards that have hardware switches obviously. Quite hard to do that on a rubberdome keyboard.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 20:46:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1824/disable-menu-key-action-and-use-it-as-i3bar-modifier/?answer=1828#post-id-1828</guid></item><item><title>Comment by raoof for &lt;p&gt;my solution to that problem:&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, I also added the Menu key to mod3. Afterwards, you also need to change the keysym of the Menu key to prevent the contextmenu action. This worked for me: `xmodmap -e "keysym Menu = Hyper_L"`. Maybe you need to additionally remove Hyper_L from other modifiers to make this work.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 10:28:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1824/disable-menu-key-action-and-use-it-as-i3bar-modifier/?answer=1881#post-id-1881</guid></item></channel></rss>
