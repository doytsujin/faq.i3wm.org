For example, I'm on worspace 1 and I switch to workspace 3, I'm still looking at workspace 2 on the second monitor rather than workspace 4. </description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 01:25:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4047/how-can-i-define-workspace-numbers-for-specific-monitors/?comment=4049#comment-4049</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;See section 4.14 of the User's Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want two workspaces per screen, assign them to the appropriate screen and they'll be created as you switch to them. Workspaces only exist after they're explicitly created, so you won't see them until you switch to them.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 13:01:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4047/how-can-i-define-workspace-numbers-for-specific-monitors/?comment=4052#comment-4052</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;See section 4.14 of the User's Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
