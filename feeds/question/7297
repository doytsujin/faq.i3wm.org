Same goes for gnome-settings-daemon. Probably the guides are referring to older versions of Gnome.

1. Are you sure there is no `network-manager-applet` package you could install. Try running `dnf install network-manager-applet` as root.

2. What happens when you run (as root) `dnf provides *nm-applet`? It should provide the name of the package (if any) that contains the applet command.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 08:00:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7297/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3-in-fedora-23/?answer=7309#post-id-7309</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Giordano for &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a Fedora 22 user, so things might have changed in the meantime.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

I had tried with `sudo dnf search` but I guess I searched with wrong terms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 15:32:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7297/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3-in-fedora-23/?comment=7316#comment-7316</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I saw another post about starting nm-applet, however such command is not available in Fedora 23.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to use NetworkManager, use NetworkManager. If Fedora 23 doesn't have it, install and configure it. nm-applet should be a part of it.

You should check the Fedora docs on this. </description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 14:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7297/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3-in-fedora-23/?answer=7300#post-id-7300</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Giordano for &lt;p&gt;There's nothing i3 specific here.
