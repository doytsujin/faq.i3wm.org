Like to have the option to lock a work space in place that it stays open even though there is no container/ window open inside (i.e. terminal session disconnects in the background and application closes).

Preferably, I could achieve this by just sending a configurable key binding to the present work space. Bonus would be colouring or other indication in the work space bar for locked in place work spaces.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 03:40:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1228/lock-workspace-to-permanent/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Couldn't find a build in way to do so.

Workspaces in i3 are created when they are used and destroyed when they are empty. This is part of the look &amp; feel and not subject to change.
