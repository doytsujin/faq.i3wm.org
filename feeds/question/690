Also note that if i3 wouldn’t focus these windows, they could steal focus themselves (and some do) — that’s an unsolvable X11 problem.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 08:21:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/690/new-created-windows-steal-focus-how-to-keep-focus-on-active/?answer=691#post-id-691</guid></item><item><title>Comment by nh2 for &lt;p&gt;You can’t currently.

I'm fine with applications still being able to rip focus from me if they really want to, but this will at least prevent me from typing my password in a wrong window when it something pops up (often). An option would be nice!</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 02:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/690/new-created-windows-steal-focus-how-to-keep-focus-on-active/?comment=2441#comment-2441</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sergej for &lt;p&gt;You can’t currently.

So IntelliJ Idea is working perfectly. Why i3wm can't perform like Unity in such case?
