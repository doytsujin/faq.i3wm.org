&gt; When you are in fullscreen mode, some
&gt; applications still open popup windows
&gt; (take Xpdf for example). This is
&gt; because these applications may not be
&gt; aware that they are in fullscreen mode
&gt; (they do not check the corresponding
&gt; hint). There are two things which are
&gt; possible to do in this situation:
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;   1. Just ignore the popup (don’t map it). This won’t interrupt you while
&gt;  &gt;   you are in fullscreen. However, some apps might react badly to this (deadlock until you go out of fullscreen).
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;   2. Leave fullscreen mode. This is the default.


I can't understand why we can't just show the popup, floating over the application, like it's done any other time ?

I think that most of the time, the popups **from the fullscreen application** are just mandatory, there is no way you can't ignore it ?


For instance, I'm thinking about a text editor, `File-&gt;Open` raises a popup, and it's logical for the application to block until you selected a file, and there is no way for the app not use this popup, every if it checked the `fullscreen` flag ...


Is there any "system level" reason to prevent that, or am I missing something ?
