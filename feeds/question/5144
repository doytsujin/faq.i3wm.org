You can find plenty of configs on various sites as GitHub, Arch Forums or various Subreddits (/r/i3wm, /r/unixporn, ..). (Sorry I can't post links yet..)

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5144/where-can-i-find-examples-for-i3-configurations/?answer=5147#post-id-5147</link><description>My configuration originated with *i3-3.Îµ*, when I migrated from *wmii*. Of course it has changed quite a bit since then - just as *i3* has - but the core is the same. [The current version of configuration can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/Adaephon-GH/i3-config).

I am using `bindcode` for my key bindings because I usually use the [Neo2 keyboard layout](http://www.neo-layout.org) but sometimes need to switch to QWERTZ as some programs just will not work properly with Neo2. With `bindcode` the *i3* key bindings remain on the same physical key.

I prefer to start out with a stacked layout. If I want to actually see two windows (on the same output) at once, I usually open the new one and move it out of the stacked container. This leads than to two (or more) stacked containers side-by-side in a horizontal split container. Sometimes I also switch to vertical split. I only rarely use tabbed or horizontal split layouts (with the aforementioned exception).

Nearly all bindings start with `Mod4` ("Super", "Windows-Key") as this key is conveniently unused by nearly every other Linux program. One big exception are the multi-media keys.

For directions in focusing, moving and resizing I mostly use the keys `I`, `J`, `K`, `L` (on QWERT[ZY]) with different modifiers, but I also have the Arrow keys bound. The modifier `Shift` usually implies movement instead of focus switch.
I also have bindings that combine focusing of the parent container and focusing in a direction, which comes in handy with `force_focus_wrapping yes`.

Lots of workspaces! Each key of the number row (with exception of the left-most and *Backspace*) is bound to two workspaces, `Mod4+&lt;key&gt;` is one, `Mod4+Control+&lt;key&gt;` the other. An additional `Shift` is again for moving a window to a workspace. I have two displays, workspaces with keys on the left-hand side are assigned to the display on the left, workspaces with keys on the right-hand side go to the display on the right.

For starting programs I use `dmenu` with a `dmenu_run`-inspired wrapper. There is a similar wrapper for running commands with `i3-msg`.

(Edit: I removed the blob with my configuration, it was just to long for this format. If, for whatever reason, [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/Adaephon-GH/i3-config) should not be reachable, you can still find the configuration in the edit history here)
