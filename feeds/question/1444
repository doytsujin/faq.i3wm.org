I think it’s better to display “no battery” because then the user can see that there is a problem and fix it. If there is no battery in that computer, it’s a one-line config change to fix this.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:01:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1444/hide-battery/?comment=1445#comment-1445</guid></item></channel></rss>
