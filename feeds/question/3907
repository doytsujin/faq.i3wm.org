Unlike som other tiling window managers, workspaces in i3 don't exist until they're explicitly created. You're basically expecting the window manager to assume that the next workspace on the assigned list is the one you'll actually want in every case in which the current workspace is removed, which is a pretty rigid assumption.

Suppose the hypothetical behavior you described were actually how i3 behaved. If the next workspace in your assigned list for the empty monitor is "04: Games," then that would be the next workspace to appear. But is "04: Games" really the next one you want? In other words, regardless of how and when the workspaces were created the outcome would be the same---you move the current workspace to a different monitor, another workspace pops up to fill its place, and most of the time you have to hit a key combination to switch to the workspace you actually want. Having specific workspaces simply appear as if they were queued up would require writing more code and using system resources for no real benefit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 16:27:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3907/workspace-with-wrong-name-generated-on-screen/?answer=3918#post-id-3918</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Man from Mars for &lt;p&gt;The workspace-to-output assignments in the configuration tell i3 which monitors workspaces should appear on when they are created, not which workspaces should be created and when.

In the described conditions this isn't happening. Otherwise everything works fine. My question is: is it just the way it's meant to be or kind of a "bug"? Probably it's the first one.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 09:04:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3907/workspace-with-wrong-name-generated-on-screen/?comment=3922#comment-3922</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Man from Mars for &lt;p&gt;The workspace-to-output assignments in the configuration tell i3 which monitors workspaces should appear on when they are created, not which workspaces should be created and when.

Given its development philosophy, I presume that's by design. What's your reason for wanting this? What advantage does it offer?</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 00:37:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3907/workspace-with-wrong-name-generated-on-screen/?comment=3921#comment-3921</guid></item></channel></rss>
