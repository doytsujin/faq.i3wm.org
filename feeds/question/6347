    bindsym $mod+KP_1 workspace $workspace1
    bindsym $mod+KP_2 workspace $workspace2
    and so on...

Now if I try to use those with a arrow key on them (i.e. KP_2, 4, 6 and 8), they do not work. Instead, one of the following bindings (i.e. the one matching the number) triggers:

    bindsym $mod+Left focus left
    bindsym $mod+Down focus down
    bindsym $mod+Up focus up
    bindsym $mod+Right focus right

The problem is, numlock is definitely turned on. The others (e.g. KP_1) work, although they have other keys on them in there non-numlocked mode too. If I map the workspace commands to the same keys but with an additional +Shift+, it works flawlessly too. If I check on them with xev while in an empty mode (so i3 cannot intercept anything), they return their correct code to (KP_*), even in combination with Mod4.

I really don't know where stuff goes wrong and think this might be a bug. I run 4.10.2 straight from Archs packages.

Thanks in advance!</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2015 20:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6347/why-is-numlock-not-working-while-executing-my-kp_-bindings/</guid></item></channel></rss>
