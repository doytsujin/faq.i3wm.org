There is no problem with that, besides the fact I lose a small space on my screen, and that it is a bit annoying (because I looks to me that it is actually another window there).

What I do to solve this is to change the window under the container as floating and tiling it back. Done, the container is now gone.

I wonder if there is a more elegant way of doing that.

Are we on the same page or are you doing what you do by mistake?</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2012 19:40:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/222/how-to-get-rid-of-another-container/?comment=224#comment-224</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;Often I find myself in this situation, in which I have 2 windows under a specific container, and I close one of them, leaving the container with a single window.&lt;/p&gt;

So, for example, on a blank workspace, open a terminal, select it as stacked (but it is only one, so nothing will actually happen), then open a new terminal... the "another container" shows up.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2012 23:17:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/222/how-to-get-rid-of-another-container/?comment=225#comment-225</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;Often I find myself in this situation, in which I have 2 windows under a specific container, and I close one of them, leaving the container with a single window.&lt;/p&gt;

Moving the container up for stacked, and sideways for tabbed, reinstates the window name in the title bar if you only have one window in that layout. One key press less than your current solution :) </description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 06:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/222/how-to-get-rid-of-another-container/?answer=231#post-id-231</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;If you are in stacked or tabbed layout, and press $mod+[hv], you'll get the 'another container' title (regardless of the amount of windows contained in that container).
