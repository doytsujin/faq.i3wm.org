I'll try with an example

I have assign th the workspace n°2 the application Thunderbird. When it's launching, TB open itself on WS2. Normal.
Sometimes, I'm moving TB on another WS, for example n°3
On the WS 3, when I try to make an attachment in a new message, the "modal" window to select a file to attach is opening in WS 2. Boring.

My question is the following : can we imagine a setting to open the "modal" windows on the same WS as the parent application, doesn't matter of the WS assignation ?

I'm not sure about the "modal" term and if I'm clear. Don't hesite to ask if need.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:20:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3296/open-floating-contextuel-windows-on-the-same-ws-in-any-case/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;Hummm it's a little bit hard to explain my problem with my poor english...

You should make a feature request on http://bugs.i3wm.org. You can refer to those windows generally as "dialog windows" as opposed to "top-level windows" and people will know what you mean.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 10:34:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3296/open-floating-contextuel-windows-on-the-same-ws-in-any-case/?comment=3301#comment-3301</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Spheerys for &lt;p&gt;Hummm it's a little bit hard to explain my problem with my poor english...

Thanks ;)

But maybe the best will be to test this property for the child windows :
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG

The main program is _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 14:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3296/open-floating-contextuel-windows-on-the-same-ws-in-any-case/?answer=3302#post-id-3302</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I have precised the rule for the exact match of the main window of my application and you were right : the child windows are now opening themselve on the current WS.

I do not have thunderbird installed on my system, but the best would be to look with `xprop` at the different window properties of the windows of thunderbird. Maybe there is a way to construct an assignment match that only works on the main window. 

Alternatively, you could make a different launcher for Thunderbird, something along the lines of:

    workspace number 2, exec thunderbird, workspace back_and_forth

This line you could put either with a key binding in your i3 config file, or you could wrap it in `i3-msg '...'`. </description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 09:53:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3296/open-floating-contextuel-windows-on-the-same-ws-in-any-case/?answer=3299#post-id-3299</guid></item></channel></rss>
