The client application simply crashes.  However, I'm able to have x2go create a new session using a different window manager (like unity).

Is there a solution or workaround?

Edit: The 'x2godesktopsharing' tray icon has its menus disabled for configuring users when running in I3. The client says 'permission denied' upon connecting. Also, manually running 'i3' from the client *does* start a new session, but the lack of proper keybindings seems to make it almost unusable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 19:55:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4366/can-x2go-work-with-i3/</guid></item></channel></rss>
