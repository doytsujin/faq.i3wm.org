 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3382/popups-during-fullscreen-mode/?answer=3384#post-id-3384</link><description>Version 3 Epsilon? At least you have the same alphabet as Platon, so you should understand the following parable: 

You have been in the darkest of the darkest caves. Not that it was an unpleasant place, but if you don't know that light exists, you don't miss it. You have upgraded to version 4.6. This allows you to see the shadows of the reality, projections of the Reality on a Higher Plan, just made black and white, two dimensional, and deformed on the rocks where they are projected on. Just continue upwards, maybe you will reach the metaphysical level of the Current Version. As of date: 4.7.2. 

The Documentation is only a bland representation of Current Reality. When using older versions, the projection might be distorted into the domain of ephemeral inconsequence. 

Sorry, just let myself go. But: Update to current version, and we can talk ;) </description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 00:44:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3382/popups-during-fullscreen-mode/?answer=3384#post-id-3384</guid></item></channel></rss>
