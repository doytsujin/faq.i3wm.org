Since everything else seems (no color changes in terminals, chrome or vlc) ok I didn't think much about it; but as it turns out my pdf viewer is also messed up (llpp; both colors and alignment). 
So now I'm starting to think that i3 changing a color might be a bug, maybe somewhere deeper and somehow connected to llpp; and here comes my question:

Did the default colors in i3 changed? If not, what might be causing this change?

I'm using i3 version 4.6 on ArchLinux; almost default settings.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2013 10:21:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2355/did-i3-introduced-new-colors/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Lately (after some update) i3 started do display little strange colours: violet/green for active/inactive window.
