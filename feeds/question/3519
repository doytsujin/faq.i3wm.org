Is there anything that can be done in i3 to fix this situation? I'll try to test with some other multi-screen window managers and see if they have the same issue. </description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3519/notifications-notify-osd-always-goes-to-screen-1/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by aspitzer for &lt;p&gt;Any time I get alerts via chrome (or anything via notify-osd) they jump the screen 1.

UPDATE:
Too many moving parts to pinpoint the solution:

1) followed instructions in changing to xfce4-notifyd (which did not seem to help initially)

2) did a software update of ubuntu 12.04 which upgraded chrome and a ton of other things.

3) updated i3 to the latest.

Now the notification (which ARE xfce) are following whichever virtual screen I am on - yay!</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 13:53:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3519/notifications-notify-osd-always-goes-to-screen-1/?answer=3520#post-id-3520</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sml for &lt;p&gt;I just confirmed that notification DO follow which ever screen you are on with the default ubuntu window manager (unity)&lt;/p&gt;
