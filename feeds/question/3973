    bindsym control+BackSpace exec xdotool keyup control &amp;&amp; sleep 0.1 &amp;&amp; xdotool key Delete
    bindcode control+135 exec xdotool keyup control &amp;&amp; sleep 0.1 &amp;&amp; xdotool key Delete

They don't seem to work. 

However, when I tried binding backspace with $mod, it actually works deleting characters to the right. Then I tried control+a and this works. So the combination of control and backspace does not work.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 11:08:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3973/binding-backspace-unsuccessful/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by phairland for &lt;p&gt;Physical problem with Delete key, so trying to bind control backspace to delete, so I tried both lines unsuccessfully:&lt;/p&gt;
