Here is what my current setup looks like:

    W W D

    Z Z D

W is a window horizontally across. On the right of it is the top half of window D. Below it is window Z. On the right half of Z is the bottom half of window D.

I would like to move window D so it looks like the following:

    W W D
    Z Z Z

Any time I try move using $mod + shift + h/j/k/l, I can't move it in where I would like it. </description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2013 20:48:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1639/how-can-i-move-a-window-beside-an-existing-window-and-keeping-it-the-same-height-as-the-existing-one/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oblique for &lt;p&gt;I know how to move windows around and create new ones vertically and horizontally, but I'm not sure about how I'd move this window along side another.
