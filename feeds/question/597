My new wheel's mouse is so sensitive than the workspaces change when I didn't asked for (the wheel is continuing to roll during several second after finger action).
An option could be usefull.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 14:31:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/597/i3bar-disable-scrolling/?comment=2352#comment-2352</guid></item><item><title>Answer by SexyBachelor for &lt;p&gt;When I scroll in the i3bar at the bottom of my i3wm, it changes my workspace.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/597/i3bar-disable-scrolling/?comment=5256#comment-5256</link><description>I think rather than providing a way to disable it, it would be far easier to just delete the feature. If is after all pretty useless if you have to move your mouse all the way to the bottom of the screen instead of using hotkeys you might as well go the extra mile and click a workspace button.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 19:29:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/597/i3bar-disable-scrolling/?comment=5256#comment-5256</guid></item><item><title>Comment by phairland for &lt;p&gt;You can’t, currently.

After I use the touchscreen for something the next action with the touchpad move the cursor to the bottom of the screen, so I don't necessarily know that I'll be scrolling over the bar.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 05:03:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/597/i3bar-disable-scrolling/?comment=2427#comment-2427</guid></item><item><title>Comment by i3wmtempcomment for &lt;p&gt;You can’t, currently.
