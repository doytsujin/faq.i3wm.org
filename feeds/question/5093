So, I end up going to another tty (ctrl+alt+f4 for example), logging in, doing startx which automatically opens gnome (I wouldn't know how to make it open anything different), and then gnome does recognise the new screen. That way I don't lose my work in i3 and I can use the second screen.

However, this is not nice. Many alternative solutions seem better and I don't know how to accomplish any.

* Start a new i3 instead of gnome


* Make the current i3 recognize the new display


* Start a new i3/gnome but only on the second display so I can watch both sessions at the same time


* Switch the current i3 to gnome without losing the stuff that is open


* ...

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the situation better?
Thanks a lot!</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 21:39:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5093/recognizing-new-display/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Rojo for &lt;p&gt;I sometimes plug my TV to my laptop while on i3, and it doesn't get automatically recognised, even if I "reload" or "restart" it.

I am still very interested in all the other alternatives however.
