workspace 1 output DVI-I-1

workspace 2 output DVI-I-1

workspace 3 output DVI-I-1

workspace 4 output DVI-I-1

workspace 5 output DVI-I-1

workspace 6 output HDMI-0

workspace 7 output HDMI-0

workspace 8 output HDMI-0

workspace 9 output HDMI-0

workspace 0 output HDMI-0

but even though at startup 0 and 6 are on their respective screens, the rest of the workspaces haven't been created yet. Thus when I switch to screen 3 it just creates it on the current screen, not on the DVI monitor. I would like my screen workspace to be locked to a particular monitor, otherwise I end up with completely disorganized screen locations (per monitor like 1,3,8 on my left monitor and 2,4,0) on the other. Anyone have a way to fix this?</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 22:44:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1062/locking-workspace-to-a-screen/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by shamgar03 for &lt;p&gt;I have placed the following in my config file:&lt;/p&gt;

Removing it fixed the problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 04:25:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1062/locking-workspace-to-a-screen/?answer=1063#post-id-1063</guid></item></channel></rss>
