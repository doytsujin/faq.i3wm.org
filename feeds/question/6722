I am trying to resolve my freeze issue in fullscree in chrome.
I have added this in my i3 config:
popup_during_fullscreen leave_fullscreen.
and tried to open a new popup. The opened window is correctly handled as a popup (as I have added a rule to make it float) but chrome still freeze and does no quit fullscreen mode.

I am using i3 4.8.

Any ideas ?

You're quite behind with 4.8. It's hard to make statements about old versions and we generally don't support them.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:30:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6722/popup_during_fullscreen-doesnt-seem-to-work/?comment=6723#comment-6723</guid></item><item><title>Answer by aacebedo for &lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;

I've updated using the official repo. I'm now running 4.10.4 and still the same issue.

It can be easily reproduced by installing chrome 46 and feedly addon. 
Then switch to fullscreen mode and click on the readitlater icon on any article
Chrome will freeze until fullscreen mode is left.

Another way to do it is to go to fullscreen mode with chrome, open two tabs, take one and slide it outside the main window. It shall freeze the same way.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 08:27:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6722/popup_during_fullscreen-doesnt-seem-to-work/?answer=6732#post-id-6732</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I still think the freeze is a Chrome problem that should be reported, though.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 08:24:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6722/popup_during_fullscreen-doesnt-seem-to-work/?comment=6763#comment-6763</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, you can change the property of the window programmatically and I think i3 will notice this as well, but the popup_during_fullscreen logic is applied when the window is managed, so updating it afterwards will be too late.

I assume the plugin scenario is the same. Note that transient windows will be floated without a rule, so having to add a rule to float them proves this.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 14:06:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6722/popup_during_fullscreen-doesnt-seem-to-work/?comment=6743#comment-6743</guid></item></channel></rss>
