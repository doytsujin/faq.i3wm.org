You can find out which version you are running by running `i3 --version`. If you find out that you are on an older version you should update if this is possible.

On the off chance that you are running a recent version it is usually possible in your package manager to see what files a given package installed.  You would want to locate `i3-save-tree` and ensure its in a directory that is included in your path.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 01:32:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5449/bash-i3-save-tree-command-not-found/?answer=5450#post-id-5450</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;i3-save-tree&lt;/code&gt; only exists as of i3 4.8.

So each question woudl need 24 answers and no one posted twice). As for voting: I think it should be based solely on the post itself is, not on who posted it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 09:30:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5449/bash-i3-save-tree-command-not-found/?comment=5484#comment-5484</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Stsosz for &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;i3-save-tree&lt;/code&gt; only exists as of i3 4.8.

That makes it difficult for the community to grow.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5449/bash-i3-save-tree-command-not-found/?comment=5488#comment-5488</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael Rose for &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;i3-save-tree&lt;/code&gt; only exists as of i3 4.8.
