So, upgrade :)

[edit] As others have pointed out, your question was about having gaps between windows. This is not supported in i3 and won’t be.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 18:33:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2006/size-hints-in-i3/?answer=2012#post-id-2012</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ThomasAdam for &lt;p&gt;Since version 4.3, we do that, too: &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOTES-4.3.txt"&gt;http://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOT...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2006/size-hints-in-i3/?comment=2025#comment-2025</link><description>I personally think size-hints are an important thing to support.  It's all very well saying "but terminals do a better job of this if there's transparency therefore we don't need to support it", but the window *provided* size hints for a reason---we should be honouring that.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 20:23:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2006/size-hints-in-i3/?comment=2025#comment-2025</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ThomasAdam for &lt;p&gt;Since version 4.3, we do that, too: &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOTES-4.3.txt"&gt;http://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOT...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
