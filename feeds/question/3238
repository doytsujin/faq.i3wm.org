Generally, how would I go about enabling the mouse wheel to change the sound volume? That is, how can I hover over the volume in the status bar and use my mouse wheel to change the sound volume?

Using the scroll-wheel anywhere on the i3bar - with exception of the tray icons - will cycle over your workspaces. 

So until the behaviour of the i3bar is more configurable, you could use a mixer application, that starts in the tray or can be minimize to the tray and reacts the scroll wheel in the indended fashion. 

Depending on your distribution there may be a few choices available.
On Ubuntu at least `kmix` does the trick. `volti` works, too, but does not support pulseaudio (although if you only want to change the master volume it may still be a viable choice).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 07:24:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3238/mouse-wheel-soundvolume/?answer=3256#post-id-3256</guid></item></channel></rss>
