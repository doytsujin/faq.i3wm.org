At work I have to use Suse 12.3 and unfortunately, 
I can't user either i3 or the neo2 layout. If i want to use both I get some errors.


This starts with the i3-config-wizard which doesn't respond to keyboard inputs.
After setting up a config-file manually and start i3,
the first thing I recognize is  that I am still on a qwertz-layout.
(I set the layout in my i3-config with exec "setxkbmap de neo")

In this situation i3 seems to work even though I have some different keycodes in the config-file.If I change the keyboard layout to neo2 my keycodes don't work anymore. 
I suppose there migth be some issue at the start-up of i3 i.e. the config-file doesn't get loaded properly. 
Any Idea what goes wrong ? Thank you for any suggestions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 09:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3909/i3-on-suse-with-different-keyboard-layout/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;I am currently using the german-neo2 keyboard layout and i3, which works fine on an ubuntu machine.&lt;/p&gt;

It would help if we could have a look on your configuration. Could you add a few relevant lines from your configuration to your question?</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 13:29:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3909/i3-on-suse-with-different-keyboard-layout/?comment=3914#comment-3914</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jr for &lt;p&gt;I am currently using the german-neo2 keyboard layout and i3, which works fine on an ubuntu machine.&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore I have i3 inside a VM on a laptop and I use Synergy such that I can type on the desktop keyboard and redirect keystrokes to the laptop. See http://synergy-project.org/

The best way to get things exactly as you want is to dump your keyboard configurations using "xmodmap -pke", edit the config, and reload using xmodmap.

Then you can apply different xmodmap configs according to context. For example I need a different keyboard config when I'm using the laptop (ansible) from my desktop (gojira) versus using the laptop standalone while away from my office.

    if [ $(ping -c 1 gojira | grep '64 bytes from gojira' | wc -l) -eq 1 ]; then
        xmodmap ~/dotfiles/dot-Xmodmap-ansible-Synergy
    else 
        xmodmap ~/dotfiles/dot-Xmodmap-ansible-ThinkPad
