happy new year! 

Is there a possiblity to to clone/duplicate a workspace?

For a presentation I want to use a LibreOffice-presentation (Impress) in presentation-mode (moderators view on workspace I on my screen and presentation in workspace II on beamer).

Beside this I want to show something "step by step" (workspace III on my screen AND beamer) in a certain program. For this I could just clone my displays but then the presentation-mode of Impress doesn't work anymore. 

So is there a way to tell i3 to clone the content of display III to display IV so that everything I do on display III is visible on display IV as well?

Thank you!

Seems like a lot of pointless work creating a slideshow only you will see when you could just type out an outline in a text editor.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 23:39:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5285/cloningduplicating-a-workspace-for-presentation-possible/?comment=5288#comment-5288</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;Hello together, &lt;/p&gt;

"Beamer" also happens to be the name of a really popular slideshow presentation module for LaTeX.

Can you clone a workspace? No. You changed from one term to the other between the first and last paragraphs, so I can't tell which you're actually interested in knowing about.

Workspaces are unique and can only be drawn to one display at a time. No window manager on any operating system allows the content of a single workspace/virtual desktop/tag/whatever to be displayed on multiple distinct displays. You *can* clone displays using RandR, however, but not dynamically. You'd need to write a script or some such to switch the display properties when needed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 23:41:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5285/cloningduplicating-a-workspace-for-presentation-possible/?answer=5289#post-id-5289</guid></item><item><title>Comment by saljut7 for &lt;p&gt;Can you clone a display?
