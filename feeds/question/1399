The tutorial on this site as well as the manual on the site of the developer tells me that I just have to replace i3status with py3status in status_command, so it looks like this:

bar {
status\_command py3status -c ~/.i3/config_i3status
}

But this is not working. All I get is that the plain JSON formatted code is printed instead of the status bar over and over again. Does anyone have the same problem? Output format in my config_i3status is set to output\_format="i3bar" as it should be.

Any ideas?</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 15:40:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1399/py3status-not-working/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to switch from i3status to py3status.

Only thing I did was adding an own module class, but going back to the old setup - as said - does not reproduce broken behaviour.

When I was playing around with own modules I put some code under the Py3status class definition to debug it from the command line. This was what caused the odd behaviour.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 13:14:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1399/py3status-not-working/?answer=1409#post-id-1409</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mschaefer for &lt;p&gt;Okay now I can answer this myself.

As py3status developer, I'll try to follow more this FAQ for any question that might arise.
