    #!/usr/bin/python
    import os
    import i3
    import sys
    import time

    def wait_for_new_window(windows):
        return i3.get_tree() == windows

    if __name__ == '__main__' or True:
        os.system(sys.argv[1] + '&amp;')
        os.system('i3 split h')
        windows = i3.get_tree()
        while wait_for_new_window(windows): time.sleep(0.1)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        os.system('i3 focus left')
        os.system('i3 kill')
Think there wil be more soon.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2012 21:12:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/28/how-do-you-use-ipc-and-scripting-libraries/?answer=333#post-id-333</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;As a satisfied, year-long, full-time user of i3, I did not get much further than playing with the configuration file, and here and there some i3-msg command.
