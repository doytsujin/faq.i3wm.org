I was a tutorial video on i3 on youtube titled "i3 Window Manager Overview"
and noticed the speaker had a transparent terminal background and his text was green. I was wondering if anyone here knows how they were able to do that? I didn't post the link because I don't know if posting links is allowed. 

I took a look at the i3 Documentation and found the following sections but they didn't seem to be what I was looking for:

4.16. Changing colors

You can change all colors which i3 uses to draw the window decorations.

4.2. Fonts

i3 has support for both X core fonts and FreeType fonts (through Pango) to render window titles.

To generate an X core font description, you can use xfontsel(1). To see special characters (Unicode), you need to use a font which supports the ISO-10646 encoding.

A FreeType font description is composed by a font family, a style, a weight, a variant, a stretch and a size. FreeType fonts support right-to-left rendering and contain often more Unicode glyphs than X core fonts.

If i3 cannot open the configured font, it will output an error in the logfile and fall back to a working font.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2015 22:51:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6284/customize-terminal-background-opacity-and-text-color-in-i3/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mechpro for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

But it should be easy to find the answer on the Internet. If you are unsure what terminal emulator you are using try running `ps $PPID` in a new terminal.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 11:23:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6284/customize-terminal-background-opacity-and-text-color-in-i3/?comment=6293#comment-6293</guid></item></channel></rss>
