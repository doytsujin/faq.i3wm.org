Is there a way to limit a (tiled) window to a maximum width, showing the desktop background instead if there's no other window to fill up the screen?

My use case is my web browser: it's in its own workspace and if it takes up the whole width of the screen, text can get hard to read. My current workaround is to open a terminal next to it, but it would be more elegant to just limit the width.

best regards,

The sole reason for a tiling WM is to always use the whole screen. </description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 10:27:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3065/limit-window-to-maximum-width/?answer=3066#post-id-3066</guid></item></channel></rss>
