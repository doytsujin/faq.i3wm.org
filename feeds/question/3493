Other than stacking, the decorations are pretty useless in terms of making the most of space on the screen.
Also, how do you make the i3bar smaller and the decoration of the window smaller?
Is there a feature such as the one achieved in wmii by Mod4+m?
All borders also can they be modified to 1pixel rather than the size they come?

If you use `none`, there will be no window decorations except in stacked and tabbed layout. With `1pixel` or `pixel &lt;size&gt;` there will only be borders, again except when stacked or tabbed. (Title bars cannot be deactivated in stacked or tabbed layout).

The size of the i3bar and the titlebar is dependent on the font size used and cannot be configured otherwise. 

Tabbed layout work in a similar way as maxed mode in `wmii`, all titles of a container are displayed side by side in a single title bar.

Border sizes can be set in border styles `pixel` and `normal`. This is probably what you want:

new_window 1pixel works perfect.
Yes tabbed and maximized seems like the same function.

Under the bar section at the config file I have:
font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 6
Changing the digit seems not have any effect on the size of the i3bar.
And where to change the font for the top bar I don't know where that option can be set.
