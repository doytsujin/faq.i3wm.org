I think updating will resolve your issues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:11:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4769/is-there-a-way-to-force-windows-to-be-floating-except-if-i-explicitly-launch-the-program-that-creates-the-window/?comment=4813#comment-4813</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;I'd like all the windows that I create myself (terminals, browsers, other programs) to be tiling, but all the windows that my OS nags me with (system updates, browser popups, network applets, etc) to appear as floating.

What applications cause problems? Are you perhaps using an outdated i3 version?</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 16:31:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4769/is-there-a-way-to-force-windows-to-be-floating-except-if-i-explicitly-launch-the-program-that-creates-the-window/?comment=4775#comment-4775</guid></item><item><title>Comment by jon.reeve for &lt;p&gt;I'd like all the windows that I create myself (terminals, browsers, other programs) to be tiling, but all the windows that my OS nags me with (system updates, browser popups, network applets, etc) to appear as floating.

Pretty much everything, really. I'm using the standard i3 from the Ubuntu repos for 14.04, version 4.7.2-1. </description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 16:53:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4769/is-there-a-way-to-force-windows-to-be-floating-except-if-i-explicitly-launch-the-program-that-creates-the-window/?comment=4779#comment-4779</guid></item></channel></rss>
