 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4857/how-to-use-chromium-with-password-storegnome-gnome-keyring-daemon/?answer=4859#post-id-4859</link><description>This answer is valid for debian testing/unstable with ligthdm as login-manager using i3 and chromium as provided by packages from the official debian apt-repositories. i3 is selected as session in lightdm

chromium has some sort of auto-detection to find the proper solution for password-storage (basic, kwallet or gnome). The auto-detection seems to fail when using i3wm.

On debian testing/unstable I force the password-store to be used by chromium by adding a file like this:

    âš¡ root@tuxi# cat /etc/chromium.d/pn-passwordstore 
    CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --password-store=gnome"

The gnome-keyring-daemon itself is started via integration with PAM.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4857/how-to-use-chromium-with-password-storegnome-gnome-keyring-daemon/?answer=4859#post-id-4859</guid></item></channel></rss>
