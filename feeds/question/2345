In your home directory, do you have the file .ssh/id\_rsa.pub? If not, you can generate a key which is not tied to any particular environment by running ssh-keygen, and just accepting all the defaults. You will then have your public key in $HOME/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub. cat the contents of that file, and copy it into your clipboard. connect to your remote host, and then append that key to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys. </description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2013 21:54:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2345/ssh-problem/?answer=2371#post-id-2371</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I've installed i3 (ver. 4.2) and i have gnome3 too but when i logged in to i3 and want to connent to ssh server, ssh can't find public keys and prompt me to enter the password. but in gnome3 every thing is ok and work. &lt;/p&gt;
