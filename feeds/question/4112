I got some output however, when trying this from a terminal:

feh WARNING: Window Manager does not support MWM hints. To get a borderless window I have to bypass your wm.

There you are. So the wm is bypassed. Can this be solved?</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 19:54:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4112/feh-on-all-workspaces/?comment=4125#comment-4125</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joelmo for &lt;p&gt;When on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) with i3dm I use feh as my image viewer in Fullscreen mode (feh -F), it appears fullscreen on ALL my workspaces, thus blocking me from doing other stuff.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4112/feh-on-all-workspaces/?comment=4141#comment-4141</link><description>In the meantime I have been puzzling a bit and found a workaround that may point to a solution:
Starting fullscreen from feh (feh -F) will bypass the wm, but starting feh normally and using fullscreen from i3 ($mod+f) works. It has trouble going DIRECTLY to fullscreen though, new pics start tiled.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 11:38:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4112/feh-on-all-workspaces/?comment=4141#comment-4141</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;When on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) with i3dm I use feh as my image viewer in Fullscreen mode (feh -F), it appears fullscreen on ALL my workspaces, thus blocking me from doing other stuff.

Running feh -F is broken in his/her configuration although it seems not to be so on my end as feh -F runs fine for me, my solution will enable feh to "go DIRECTLY to fullscreen" as Maestraccio stated he/she wanted.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 21:14:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4112/feh-on-all-workspaces/?comment=4148#comment-4148</guid></item><item><title>Comment by ANOKNUSA for &lt;p&gt;You can make all feh instances automatically fullscreen by adding this to your config file&lt;/p&gt;
