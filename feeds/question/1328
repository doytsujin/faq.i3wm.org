 $ wget -O - debian.sur5r.net

Connecting to debian.sur5r.net (debian.sur5r.net)|217.8.49.41|:80... failed: Connection refused.

I'd like to bring this topic up again, because the problem bruno.braga refers to seems to be still existing. Is there any new information on how long it will take to fix? For the moment I'm experimenting with the 4.4 version from the developer repo but I would not like to keep it that way forever...</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 09:45:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1328/ubuntu-repository-not-working/?answer=1347#post-id-1347</guid></item></channel></rss>
