After some days of using i3, I managed to edit the conf file for i3 itself and i3status to my needs. Basically I only changed the colors to fit my zenburn vim and added some shortcuts for often used programs. 
Because I did not find a lot of examples and config files from other users, I thought I might share mine.

I am looking forward to see some more advanced examples.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2013 22:31:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1904/i3config-and-i3statusconf/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dkeg for &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
