Unfortunately, this does not work.

This line in my .i3/config works fine:
bindsym $mod+Return exec i3-sensible-terminal

This does not:
bindsym $mod+asciicircum exec i3-sensible-terminal

Where is my mistake?
For the record, my keyboard layout is de, with adkeys.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 09:40:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3096/how-to-use-asciicircum-in-a-key-binding/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Scrabz for &lt;p&gt;I want to change the default key binding for starting a terminal from $mod+Enter to $mod+asciicircum.

The correct name for the key in the config is dead_circumflex instead of asciicircum.
