I have a .desktop file that starts an application just fine when using Gnome. However, when using i3-dmenu-desktop to start it, nothing happens. How can I debug what's going on? I tried running i3-dmenu-desktop in a terminal window, but there were no error messages at all.

This is the .desktop file:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=SI Windowed
    Exec=env WINEPREFIX="/home/nikratio/.wine" wine C:\\\\windows\\\\command\\\\start.exe /Unix /home/nikratio/.wine/dosdevices/c:/users/Public/Start\\ Menu/Programs/Cryptic\\ Comet/SI\\ Windowed.lnk
    Type=Application
    StartupNotify=true
    Path=/home/nikratio/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files/Cryptic Comet/Solium Infernum
    Icon=0FCC_Solium Infernum Windowed.0

More to the point, however, is checking the i3 logfile for the command that i3 receives. See http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html for details.

Once you checked the logfile and verified that the .desktop file is actually correct with regards to escaping, feel free to open a bug at http://bugs.i3wm.org/</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 21:11:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4075/how-to-debug-i3-dmenu-desktop/?answer=4190#post-id-4190</guid></item></channel></rss>
