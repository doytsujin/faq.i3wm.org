 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2787/move-floating-window-with-arrows/?answer=2790#post-id-2790</link><description>As for just moving windows around with arrow keys, it uses the same command as moving tiled windows around. So this would be the way:

    mode "moveit" {
        bindsym Up move up 20px
        bindsym Left move left 20px
        bindsym Down move down 20px
        bindsym Right move right 20px
        bindsym Mod4+m mode "default"
    }
    bindsym Mod4+m focus floating; mode "moveit"

&lt;Super&gt;+m will focus the last active floating window and enter "moveit" mode. With the arrow keys you can move the window by 20 pixels. Giving a pixel value is optional with 10px as the default. 

Moving windows to a specific screen border is a lot trickier as there are no readymade commands for this. You can move a window to the left upper corner with `move position 0px 0px`. Any other corner or edge is not that easy as it is dependent on window sizes and screen size. 
One way to achieve this is with *xdotool*, some scripting and probably a lot of trial and error as xdotool does not take in account borders and title bars. For example: `xdootol getwindowfocus windowmove 0 0` moves the window to the upper left corner, but so far, that the title bar and left border are outside the screen.
