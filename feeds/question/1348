is there any way to access workspaces by there position in the workspace list rather then by there number or name? Or does anyone have an idea, how to achieve such a behavior?

Let me give you an excample on what I am trying to do here:

I have, let's say, 4 workspaces ("a", "b", "c", "d"), which are accessible via Mod1+1 to Mod1+4. Now I close every Window on workspace "b" and switch to workspace "a". So workspace "b" gets destroyed on the fly (as I recall correctly). The list of workspaces presented in the status bar now shows "[a] [c] [d]". And now I want to be able to switch to workspace "d" via - here comes the trick - Mod1+3, because "d" is third in list.

Why would someone do this, you might ask?

I'am often using mobile devices with small screens (small laptop, netbook) and I have only with few applications open. There, screenspace is very limited and every pixel is of value. So I put single windows on a new workspace just to keep them as big as possible. And therefore apllications get closed where often. On the other hand side, Mod1+1 to Mod1+5 is far easier to reach than Mod1+6 to Mod1+9 or even Mod1+0. So I find my self moving applications very often from one workspace to another workspace, which is more to the left side on the key bind list. I got the idea while playing around with GNOME3 for some days (just out of curiosity), where dynamic workspaces kinda implemented like that.

I just needed to use a trick to get proper workspace names out of my configuration. I define workspace names with a specific set of variables in my configuration file, something like "set $workspace1 WorkspaceOne" which I can then grep out of the configuration file.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 16:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1348/workspace-list-collapse-feature-like-in-gnome3/?answer=1361#post-id-1361</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

You just need to get the list of workspaces, then access that list by index and tell i3 to switch to that workspace.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 18:13:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1348/workspace-list-collapse-feature-like-in-gnome3/?answer=1350#post-id-1350</guid></item></channel></rss>
