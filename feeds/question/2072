So I asked this question in the IRC page and got it working with the help of friendly folks there, so I'll answer myself.

**First** of all, make sure you have i3 version &gt;= 4.5.  The version included in the Debian Wheezy repos is 4.2, which will exit with an error "XKB not supported by X-server".  
To install on Debian Wheezy, I had to enable the backports repository by adding:

    [web search for how to add backports, I don't have enough 'karma' to post the deb line cause it has a http link in it]

to /etc/apt/sources.list (replace 'ftp.us.debian.org' with your favorite mirror)
and installing i3 version 4.5 like so:

    aptitude update
    aptitude -t wheezy-backports install i3

**Second**, make sure the ~/.vnc/xstartup file has the Xsession line commented out or removed, and "i3" or "i3 &amp;" (without quotes) is the last line.

    #!/bin/sh
    
    xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
    xsetroot -solid grey
    #x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &amp;
    #x-window-manager &amp;
    #Fix to make GNOME work
    export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
    #/etc/X11/Xsession
    i3 &amp;

You may also have to use the line "DISPLAY=:1 i3" instead, if you plan on running the VNC server in a different display (replace '1' with your chosen display number).

**Third**, make sure you have a terminal emulator installed.  I did not, and after getting i3 working over VNC, I could not open a terminal by pressing $mod+Enter.  I installed rxvt, but you may have another already installed, or choose a favorite.

**Fourth**, running i3 in a VNC session will create a bad config file with all the key bindings replaced with "Mod1+(null)".  I just copied a local config file over but you can also copy the one from /etc/i3/config.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 19:27:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2072/how-do-i-get-i3-to-run-over-a-vnc-connection/?answer=2073#post-id-2073</guid></item></channel></rss>
