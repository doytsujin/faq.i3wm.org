I find it very distracting opening a dialog in one edge, and the next dialog in the other edge and so on.

I'm using: 

&lt;code&gt;for_window [class=".*"] move position center&lt;/code&gt;

but it only works by restarting i3 after the dialog is already visible. I suppose the issue here is that some programs will save windows positions, so i3 will try to center them and then the program will move it to the end position. Am I correct?

How can I solve this?</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 09:25:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4193/how-to-place-all-floating-windows-in-the-center/</guid></item></channel></rss>
