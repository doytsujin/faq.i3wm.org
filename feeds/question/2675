You didn’t say what happens, but I think the flash player might also go out of fullscreen (i.e. close) when you move it to a non-visible workspace.

There is http://deve.loping.net/projects/ignoflash/downloads/ which apparently patches flash to disable that behavior. Worth a try. Or using HTML5 video instead ;).</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 21:33:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2675/when-flash-player-fullscreen-move-to-another-window/?answer=2676#post-id-2676</guid></item><item><title>Comment by flylo for &lt;p&gt;One of the flash player’s features is that it will drop out of fullscreen on a number of occasions, such as when moving the mouse pointer to a different monitor.

Thanks for your suggestion, I'll have a look. It's not a huge deal though, was just me hacking about.
Thanks for your help :)</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 21:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2675/when-flash-player-fullscreen-move-to-another-window/?comment=2678#comment-2678</guid></item><item><title>Answer by stealz for &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to move the flash player when it goes full screen (ie youtube), and move it to another window and keep it there.

there is a hex hack for the libflashplayer.so around,
you can try http://simonmott.co.uk/blog/view/11 for a possible version.

the idea is to open libflashplayer.so or libgcflashplayer.so with a hex editor and search it for _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and replace one of the letters, for example to _AET_ACTIVE_WINDOW 

that will fix the issue of closing fullscreen flash when losing focus</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 22:02:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2675/when-flash-player-fullscreen-move-to-another-window/?answer=3737#post-id-3737</guid></item><item><title>Comment by phairland for &lt;p&gt;it is a flashplayer problem, it will exit fullscreen when it loses focus.&lt;/p&gt;
