However, it cannot possibly show all **potential** workspaces. The command `i3-msg workspace ##`, where `##` is some arbitrary integer, will open up workspace `##`. (I say "arbitrary" because although I don't know if there are any limits on how large `##` can be, I successfully tried it with `25818446744073709551615`, and it worked just fine.)

In other words, there are an unlimited number of workspaces that **could** exist, so it would be impossible to show them **all** at any given time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:31:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2319/show-all-workspaces-including-inactive-workspaces-in-i3bar/?answer=2667#post-id-2667</guid></item><item><title>Answer by syl20bnr for &lt;p&gt;I've recently started using i3.
