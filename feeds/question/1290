If you right-click in the terminal or use the menu you can edit the profile and REMOVE the check from "Use colours from system theme" up at the top. This will resolve your issue if you select white on black or whatever else.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2013 18:54:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1290/my-terminal-and-fonts-are-black-during-an-i3-session-help/?answer=1789#post-id-1789</guid></item><item><title>Answer by dkeg for &lt;p&gt;This doesn't happen when I use my terminal in a typical cinnamon/LM13 session. &lt;/p&gt;

Try reading through this to see if possibly we just need to get the gnome settings running ....

i have the default terminal given to me by linux mint 13, cinnamon.
