The problem solves when I open new terminal window.

I guess this causes i3 to redraw or reposition windows so garbage in mmy newsbeutter window dissapears.

Is there any way to do this manually ?</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 10:03:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2069/how-to-force-i3-to-redrawreposition-screen/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;I have some problems with newsbeuter, chrome and i3 as shown on this image:&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect that when you set your default browser in newsbeuter to a simple shell script which starts chrome but disregards the standard output/standard error, the problem goes away:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec google-chrome $* &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

Also, as a general hint: i3 never draws window contents, it only draws borders. When an application has any kind of corruption in its window, that is usually either a driver problem or caused by the application itself. In terminal apps, Ctrl-L usually triggers a refresh.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 06:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2069/how-to-force-i3-to-redrawreposition-screen/?answer=2099#post-id-2099</guid></item></channel></rss>
