My i3 is managing windows in the followind way: when i open a window on a workspace and then move to another workspace and try to open another window of the same program(like, two terminals), instead of thew new window showing up in the workspace that I am in at the moment, it will show up on the same workspace that the previous windows of the same program is present.
So, any way of changing this so when I open a window, it allways shows up in the workspace tha I have selected?</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 02:45:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6389/stop-similar-windows-from-opening-on-the-same-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I've been having this problem that i could swear was not happening yesterday.

Also, upload your i3 config somewhere and post the link.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 06:43:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6389/stop-similar-windows-from-opening-on-the-same-workspace/?comment=6390#comment-6390</guid></item></channel></rss>
