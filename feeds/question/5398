I think what's happening is that I've also got a terminal set to open with a particular name and used a `for_window` assignment to move it to the scratchpad. I think this is leaving no workspace selected and then the browser doesn't have a workspace to show up on, even though I open it via `exec i3-msg "workspace number 4; exec google-chrome"` as the last thing in my config. When this glitchy thing happens, I have to select a workspace (via the mouse as the keybindings to select one don't work either) and then open a new instance of the browser, which opens both windows. Sometimes it works just fine, which leads me to believe that there's probably a race condition. 

My questions are:

1. Is it possible to move the terminal window into the scratchpad and leave another workspace selected?

2. Is there a better way to move the terminal to the scratchpad?
