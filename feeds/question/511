But today I bought a second monitor and experienced a strange behaviour when moving windows to a workspace on the other monitor.

I enabled "workspace auto back and forth" and changed the bindsyms to something like "bindsym ..... move workspace x; workspace x". Now when I move my window to another monitor, the focus stays on the current one because "move workspace x" changes focus automatically for different monitors.

Is there a possibility to let "move workspace x" behave with different monitors like with a single one?

I would appreciate if someone could help me.

Actually I think it's kind of a feature that I didn't understand.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:10:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/511/workspace-moving-behaviour-across-multiple-screens/?comment=514#comment-514</guid></item><item><title>Comment by iiiuser for &lt;p&gt;Hello, thanks for this beautiful window manager.

Workspace 1 is the left monitor, Workspace 2 the right one. If I press Super+Shift+2 to move a window to workspace 2 and directly change focus, only the window will be moved.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:06:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/511/workspace-moving-behaviour-across-multiple-screens/?comment=513#comment-513</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hello, thanks for this beautiful window manager.
