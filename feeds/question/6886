I am using several applications (like gedit, gnome-calculator etc., actually all the gnome applications) which use their own title bar and window borders and I have not found an opportunity to disable this behaviour in the application preferences itself.

Therefore it is hard do see which window is focused at a specific moment --- especially when I am using multiple of those applications at the same time next to each other --- as these custom window title and border do not change their color depending on whether they are focused.

Is there any possibility to configure i3 to force all applications to use the global customized window borders and prohibit custom ones in order to be able to better see which application is active at the moment?

Thanks in advance.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 13:36:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6886/force-i3-window-borders-and-title-bar/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
