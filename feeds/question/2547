The office tells me if some small windows manager, like i3, does not follow freedesktop standard, then the crossover will do not work well.

We follow a couple of them entirely (xdg basedir), others to a high degree (.desktop files with i3-dmenu-desktop) and others only partly or not at all.

I am not sure what your actual question is. Given that CrossOver itself is not FOSS, we don’t really care whether it works or not. In case you have an issue that is easily fixable and ideally also reproducible with WINE itself, feel free to report a bug at http://bugs.i3wm.org/</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 02:46:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2547/does-i3-support-freedesktop-standard-fully/?answer=2548#post-id-2548</guid></item><item><title>Comment by acgtyrant for &lt;p&gt;There are many freedesktop standards, not just a single one: the desktop entry specification, xdg basedir specification, desktop menu specification, …&lt;/p&gt;

Actually the office have advised that the user which use advancded Linux distro, like archlinux, should use wine. I will try it now, thank you for your fast feedback!</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 02:50:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2547/does-i3-support-freedesktop-standard-fully/?comment=2552#comment-2552</guid></item></channel></rss>
