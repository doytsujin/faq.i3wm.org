I want to have keepassx hidden in scratchpad, so it's available on any workspace via keybind.
So I did this:

    for_window [instance="scratchpad"] move scratchpad
    bindsym $mod+k [class="(?i)keepassx" instance="scratchpad"] scratchpad show
    exec --no-startup-id keepassx -name scratchpad

Works nice, with one problem. Any dialog window from keepassx is moved to scratchpad when it's opened, for example when editing an entry, setting dialog or  something.... So I have to press mod+K to bring it up.
That's not comfortable…

Do you have any idea? The keepassx main or dialog window doesn't have the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property, so I can't filter the dialog windows :(</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 23:07:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5258/keepassx-in-scratchpad-with-keybind-toggle/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Hi guys,

Perhaps send a patch? :)</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:50:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5258/keepassx-in-scratchpad-with-keybind-toggle/?answer=5271#post-id-5271</guid></item></channel></rss>
