    local/i3-wm 4.7.2-1 (i3)

    local/i3status 2.8-2 (i3)

i3bar displays `%status` and `%percentage` fine, but for *some* reason `%remaining`, `%emptytime` and `%consumption` *only* show up if the battery is charging and has &lt;100% of the design capacity. 

I guess it has something to do with me running i3 on the Samsung Chromebook as battery has always been a little weird even with the xfce applets, but I can't find the culprit. Here's the relevant part of my `.i3status.conf`: 

    battery 0 {
        last_full_capacity = true
        format = "%status %percentage %remaining %emptytime %consumption"
        path = "/sys/class/power_supply/sbs-4-000b/uevent"
    }

And here's the content of `/sys/class/power_supply/sbs-4-000b/uevent` @ around 97% (according to i3status) and charging:

    POWER_SUPPLY_NAME=sbs-4-000b
    POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS=Charging
    POWER_SUPPLY_HEALTH=Good
    POWER_SUPPLY_PRESENT=1
    POWER_SUPPLY_TECHNOLOGY=Li-ion
    POWER_SUPPLY_CYCLE_COUNT=42
    POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=8550000
    POWER_SUPPLY_CURRENT_NOW=1159000
    POWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY=97
    POWER_SUPPLY_TEMP=311
    POWER_SUPPLY_TIME_TO_EMPTY_AVG=3932100
    POWER_SUPPLY_TIME_TO_FULL_AVG=1740
    POWER_SUPPLY_SERIAL_NUMBER=1dc9
    POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_MIN_DESIGN=7500000
    POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_MAX_DESIGN=7500000
    POWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_NOW=29540000
    POWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_FULL=32350000
    POWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_FULL_DESIGN=30600000
    POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_NOW=3906000
    POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_FULL=4242000
    POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN=4080000
    POWER_SUPPLY_MANUFACTURER=SDI
    POWER_SUPPLY_MODEL_NAME=4302D40

I assume i3status reads `POWER_SUPPLY_TIME_TO_EMPTY_AVG` for `%emptytime`, so it's there but for some reason only gets read when the charger is plugged in? The same goes for `POWER_SUPPLY_TIME_TO_FULL_AVG`, but at least that makes sense as I only want to see it when I'm actually charging. 

(And in case you're wondering: `POWER_SUPPLY_TIME_TO_EMPTY_AVG` does decrease when you unplug the charger, so it's not some weird bug which keeps it a constant number)

Oh and `last_full_capacity = true` doesn't work at all for me. But it should, because the battery is regularly charging &gt;100% and also `acpi -V` shows this output:

    Battery 0: design capacity 4080 mAh, last full capacity 4253 mAh = 100%

Any ideas on how I could fix these things? What I need/want most is having `%emptytime` work, and `%consumption` would be nice but isn't a must.
