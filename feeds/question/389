I try to memorize where my open programs are, so that I don't have to cycle through them. But it's still handy from time to time.

I have got the tip from the following [forum post.](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1281/application-switcher/)</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 20:47:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?answer=2735#post-id-2735</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lzap for &lt;p&gt;Hello, it seems Alt+Tab combination is not used and I wonder if I could set something like "focus next".

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?answer=2732#post-id-2732</link><description>Thank you! I use the "stacked" layout almost entirely (vertical tabs), and have made this small adjustment to the above suggestion to cycle through them, and it works beautifully

    bindsym Mod1+Tab focus up
    bindsym Mod1+Shift+Tab focus down

Now one of my most engrained lifelong habits from 'other' window managers is serving me once again in i3. Love it! =D

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?answer=1168#post-id-1168</link><description>Here's a Python function that implements a generic focus next command using i3-py:

    def focus_next():
        num = i3.filter(i3.get_workspaces(), focused=True)[0]['num']
        ws_nodes = i3.filter(num=num)[0]['nodes']
        curr = i3.filter(ws_nodes, focused=True)[0]
    
        ids = [win['id'] for win in i3.filter(ws_nodes, nodes=[])]
    
        next_idx = (ids.index(curr['id']) + 1) % len(ids)
        next_id = ids[next_idx]
    
        i3.focus(con_id=next_id)

Adding that will capture the floating nodes too.</description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 15:09:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?comment=5824#comment-5824</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Here's a Python function that implements a generic focus next command using i3-py:&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?answer=880#post-id-880</link><description>The problem with the selected answer is that "right" and "left" only work properly on a horizontal layout. With these bindings and a vertical layout, nothing happens. There doesn't appear to be generic "focus next" / "focus prev" so my instinct is to write an i3-py script to first try "right", see if the current window changed and, if not, try "down" instead.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 16:31:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/389/focus-next-window/?answer=880#post-id-880</guid></item></channel></rss>
