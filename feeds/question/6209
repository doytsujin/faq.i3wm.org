One is in dock mode at the left, and the other one is in hide mode on the right. The right one is shown when the mod key is pressed.

Now, I want to show the bar when the cursor is over a certain screen region (without using the keyboard), so I've made a basic python script that checks for that with the help of xdotool and I just need to send the command to actually show the bar.

I've tried using 

    i3-msg "bar mode dock"

But it didn't work because both bars were shown / hidden.

So my question basically is, how can I send a message to i3 so only one of the two bars is shown?

Each bar instance can have an id assigned (by default this is bar-0, bar-1, ...). So you can use ```i3 bar mode dock bar-0``` to change the mode of the first bar instance or ```i3 bar mode dock``` to change the mode of all bar instances. The same works for all other bar commands. If you want you can also set the id of the yourself:
```
bar {
    id 1
    ...
}
```</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 09:27:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6209/show-or-hide-i3bar-on-a-specific-output/?answer=6339#post-id-6339</guid></item><item><title>Comment by setzer22 for &lt;p&gt;You actually can do this.

I had already tried the id approach, but it seems i3-msg wasn't able to work with that kind of commands.</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 13:56:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6209/show-or-hide-i3bar-on-a-specific-output/?comment=6534#comment-6534</guid></item></channel></rss>
