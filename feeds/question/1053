If so, i am sure the maintainers are not interested enough in this feature to write it themselves. </description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 06:22:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1053/edge-resistance-or-window-snapping/?comment=1064#comment-1064</guid></item><item><title>Comment by naq for &lt;p&gt;There are some other window managers around that have specialized on floating. i3 as of yet is not such a window manager ;)&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1053/edge-resistance-or-window-snapping/?comment=1061#comment-1061</link><description>I don't want another window manager and I don't want a floating window manager. I like i3 very much. For the last three or so days I have worked hard on configuring every little thing about it. It's the best I've tried, and I tried almost all of them. I wanted edge resistance for pidgin &amp; skype etc.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 22:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1053/edge-resistance-or-window-snapping/?comment=1061#comment-1061</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;There are some other window managers around that have specialized on floating. i3 as of yet is not such a window manager ;)&lt;/p&gt;

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1053/edge-resistance-or-window-snapping/?answer=1069#post-id-1069</link><description>For skype I have a simple setup that works for me. I give it a dedicated workspace when I use it, and this thing in my config: `for_window [class="^Skype"] move right`. I manually make the first chat window a vertical split, and manually move the border between the contact list and the other windows. </description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 21:38:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1053/edge-resistance-or-window-snapping/?answer=1069#post-id-1069</guid></item></channel></rss>
