I've also adjusted the grub setting to set the console in 1920x1200 mode, but as soon as I start xorg, it falls back to 1024x768. There's no xorg.conf file, as far as I can tell.

Stock Ubuntu 15.04, minimal server intall + i3 + xorg, running under Parallels (with tools installed) on Mac OSX 10.10.4.

Any tips/pointers would be very much appreciated!

Then, X comes up in 1920x1200 right away, and i3 adopts that.

Maybe there's a cleaner solution which doesn't hack things like this, but this works for now.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2015 22:43:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6441/how-to-make-i3-fill-the-screen/?answer=6442#post-id-6442</guid></item></channel></rss>
