When I am in a conversation I would like to run a terminal sometimes to check something, and paste to a friend, or co worker. 

But, the terminal window is shown under pidin and I can focus it but pidgin is always on the top. I cannot bring the terminal to the front neither with mouse nor with the keyboard.

The only way to get a window in front of a floating window is to make it a floating window itself. You can do that with the `floating enable` or `floating toggle` (by default bound to **Mod1**+**Shift**+**space**) commands.

----

That being said, *i3* is a tiling window manager and is designed to be used as such. Support for floating windows is rather rudimentary and mainly exists for only two reasons: dialog windows and applications that just can not handle being resized. 

So my real suggestion is, not to run *pidgin* in floating mode. I am also using `pidgin` and have yet to encounter any problems that would require it to run in floating mode. </description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 13:30:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5507/move-non-floating-window-to-front-of-floating-window/?answer=5511#post-id-5511</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Adaephon for &lt;p&gt;Floating windows are always on top of tiled windows.

Any conversation windows I then keep in the left container. I usually keep my machine running, so there is really no benefit in automating the layout.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2015 22:53:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5507/move-non-floating-window-to-front-of-floating-window/?comment=5520#comment-5520</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tdi for &lt;p&gt;Floating windows are always on top of tiled windows.
