 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1241/i3-users-guide-need-updating/?answer=1243#post-id-1243</link><description>Since you are using version 4.2, the appropriate documentation for your version is:

http://i3wm.org/docs/4.2/userguide.html

The current version of the userguide is for the latest stable version of i3: v4.4. This is also described on http://i3wm.org/docs/

Now, as to the actual question: That binding is still correct, so we donâ€™t need to update any documentation.

If i3 crashes for you reproducibly, please file a bugreport at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

Note that you need to upgrade first. Only the latest stable release is supported.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 18:14:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1241/i3-users-guide-need-updating/?answer=1243#post-id-1243</guid></item></channel></rss>
