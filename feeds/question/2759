In `~/.config/i3/config`:

    for_window [title="^floatme$"] floating enable

Then to get a floating Emacs, run:

    emacs -Q -T floatme

It would be nice to have a solution that didn't rely on the application being able to set its title though.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2013 23:59:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2759/open-a-program-in-floating-mode-just-once/?answer=2760#post-id-2760</guid></item><item><title>Comment by msx for &lt;p&gt;The application I had in mind happens to be Emacs; I found a solution that works for this case at least.&lt;/p&gt;
