I'm using i3 4.8 and some times (approximatively one a week), i3 is buging.
There is a window problem from an (crashed?) application and even if I reload i3, the bug stay.
The only solution I have found is to restart X

That being said: Is it always the same application that crashes? Did you also try restarting i3 with the `restart` command? Does `i3-msg -t get_tree` show a window at that place?</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2015 22:28:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5554/window-bugcrash/?comment=5586#comment-5586</guid></item></channel></rss>
