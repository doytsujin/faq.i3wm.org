    grep '+Return' ~/.i3/config
    bindsym Mod1+Return exec i3-sensible-terminal

Then, verify that the terminal emulator which you use in your config is actually installed. In this case, i3-sensible-terminal is a wrapper which tries to start the first one of urxvt, rxvt, terminator, Eterm, aterm, xterm, gnome-terminal, roxterm, xfce4-terminal.

So, install e.g. urxvt and retry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:25:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1378/cannot-open-a-terminal-with-i3-on-fedora/?answer=1379#post-id-1379</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Jungolona for &lt;p&gt;Check the config file (~/.i3/config or /etc/i3/config if you aborted the wizard) for the line binding $mod+Return:&lt;/p&gt;
