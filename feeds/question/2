 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3/?answer=3#post-id-3</link><description>Just start `nm-applet` when launching i3. So, in your i3 configuration file `~/.i3/config`, add a line saying:

    exec --no-startup-id nm-applet

Also note that you need to have a proper ConsoleKit session running to be authorized to use NetworkManager. You can verify that using `ck-list-sessions | grep is-local` which should print `is-local = TRUE`. In case you see FALSE there, use a display manager like gdm to login and start i3. It will not work with xdm currently (as of 2012-06-04), unless you use a patched version.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 13:12:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3/?answer=3#post-id-3</guid></item><item><title>Comment by yhager for &lt;p&gt;Just start &lt;code&gt;nm-applet&lt;/code&gt; when launching i3.

However, I've had strange issues with mouse under-clicks after resume. I never known it's related to nm, but when I stopped using it, the issues stopped. I'm now using netctl.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:59:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2/how-can-i-use-networkmanager-with-i3/?comment=5389#comment-5389</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Benoitt for &lt;p&gt;When running i3, how can I use NetworkManager to configure wireless/wired connections?&lt;/p&gt;
