First I add

    assign [class="VirtualBox"] 9

(for the test, I always open VirtualBox from workspace 2)
This works proper, as soon as the workspace+window is opened, workspace 9's indicator appears, in red; and my focus is still on the same workspace (2) and window.

Now I want to add a layout change to that same class:

    assign [class="VirtualBox"] 9
    for_window [class="VirtualBox"] layout stacking

This time, workspace 9 appears in the background, not red but grey colored. Focus is still on the same workspace (all windows lose focus). 
BUT instead of being blue (which indicates focus for both workspace and window) everything is grey. This tells me the focus is somewhere else.

To get focus back to the workspace I see in front of me, I have to explicitly press $mod+workspaceNumber

Is there a better way?

I tried:

    assign [class="VirtualBox"] 9
    for_window [class="VirtualBox"] layout stacking, focus tiling
since the manual says "focus_tililing: return focus to last tiling container", but it doesn't seem to have to correct effect.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 20:00:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4692/focus-workspace-window-after-for_window/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with 'assign' and 'for_window' &lt;/p&gt;
