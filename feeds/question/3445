i installed arch linux, with gnome on my macbook pro 8.1. After 1 day i tried i3, and don't like gnome no more. All works well except the media keys of the keyboard (brightness, volume, etc). 

I read, that one could use `gnome-settings-daemon` but that doesn't work for me. Do i have something else than adding `exec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon` to my `.i3/config`?

Thanks in advance!</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 21:34:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3445/change-brightness-in-i3-macbook-pro/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;Hi guys, &lt;/p&gt;

You have to have a program to be executed, that has the needed ability though. `xbacklight` and `alsamixer` come to mind, but there are a bunch of alternatives.  

[xev](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Extra_Keyboard_Keys) is a great tool to get the definition of any pressed key. Media keys are recognized (most of the times) and can be used by their name.
