I am using Debian jessie with i3. For update notifications I use apticron, but I'd like to have a notification when I recieve system mail. There would be mail-notification, but it would install 206MB of additional bulls*it as it depends on Gnome or KDE or something like that.

Is there a lightweight alternative to mail-notification for i3?

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5165/mail-notification-for-a-plain-i3-desktop/?answer=5490#post-id-5490</link><description>You could try [dunst](http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html). It is a minimal (as in great) notify daemon.

&gt;  Dunst is a lightweight replacement
&gt; for the notification-daemons provided
&gt; by most desktop environments. It's
&gt; very customizable, doesn't depend on
&gt; any toolkits and therefore fits in
&gt; those windowmanager centric setups we
&gt; all love to customize to perfection.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 22:37:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5165/mail-notification-for-a-plain-i3-desktop/?answer=5490#post-id-5490</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Gamonics for &lt;p&gt;Hello!
