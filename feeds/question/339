&gt; You can also switch to the next and previous workspace with the commands workspace next and workspace prev, which is handy, for example, if you have workspace 1, 3, 4 and 9 and you want to cycle through them with a single key combination. To restrict those to the current output, use workspace next_on_output and workspace prev_on_output. Similarly, you can use move container to workspace next and move container to workspace prev to move a container to the next/previous workspace.
