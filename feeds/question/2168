On my laptop it just works but not on the desktop. What mechanism is used by cpu_temperature module, is there something I need to install ?

edit: I see it's saying to check in  /sys/class/thermal to see if there is a thermal zone. There are 2 links there cooling_device0 and 1 I guess for mu 2 core cpu. Inside either of them ls gives:
0 power  0 cur_state  0 device  0 max_state  0 subsystem  0 type  0 uevent

I'm checking to see the content of the files but nothing useful as of yet</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2013 11:59:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2168/cant-read-temp/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Goran for &lt;p&gt;I get this message instead of cpu temperature.

I checked dmesg and maybe It's me not knowing what to look for but I didn't saw any Warnings or Errors in there.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 08:59:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2168/cant-read-temp/?answer=2201#post-id-2201</guid></item><item><title>Answer by joepd for &lt;p&gt;I get this message instead of cpu temperature.

Have a look at your boot messages with for example `dmesg`. For me, it was complaining about an outdated BIOS. A BIOS upgrade made those temperatures available. </description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 06:27:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2168/cant-read-temp/?answer=2194#post-id-2194</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;If there are no files called &lt;code&gt;/sys/class/thermal/thermalzone[[:digit:]]/term&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel has no information about temperatures of devices.

Guess you're better off checking the docs of your distro, as there might be particularities. Good luck :) </description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 10:12:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2168/cant-read-temp/?comment=2203#comment-2203</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;If there are no files called &lt;code&gt;/sys/class/thermal/thermalzone[[:digit:]]/term&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel has no information about temperatures of devices.

What can I do about that? EDIT: Nope I'm just blind, I used the sample config and it has a line telling it to look in the wrong path. </description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 22:21:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2168/cant-read-temp/?comment=2221#comment-2221</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Goran for &lt;p&gt;If there are no files called &lt;code&gt;/sys/class/thermal/thermalzone[[:digit:]]/term&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel has no information about temperatures of devices.
