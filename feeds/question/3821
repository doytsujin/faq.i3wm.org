For e.g.: currently I let chromium at 2: browser by default, but sometime I am in 3: text editor and would like to open a browser in the same workspace, I want to ignore that for_window just for once, any command to do that?</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2014 02:07:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3821/ignore-for_window/?comment=3825#comment-3825</guid></item><item><title>Comment by lkraav for &lt;p&gt;I have for_window to put certain apps in some certain workspace, but sometime I need to ignore this rule and open the app in the current workspace.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3821/ignore-for_window/?answer=3846#post-id-3846</link><description>There are two ways to do that - that I can think of:

1. Depending on the application and criteria you are using, it may be possible to start the application in a way that does not trigger the rule. GTK applications for example have the `--class=CLASS` option, which allows changing the `WM_CLASS`. Titles can be changed, too, in many applications.

2. You could keep a set of two configuration files, one with `for_window` statements and a copy without them, with `~/.i3/config` being a link to the one currently used. For starting you then could use the following wrapper script (then use `wrapper application --options` instead of `application --options`)

&lt;!-- --&gt;

    #!/bin/sh
    CFG="${HOME}/.i3/config"
    CFGFOR="${CFG}-withfor"
    CFGNOFOR="${CFG}-nofor"
    # switch to configuration without for_window
    ln -sf "$CFGNOFOR" "$CFG"
    i3-msg reload
    # start anything passed as arguments to this script
    "$@" &amp;
    # wait one second for the window to be initialized
    # this may need to be longer for some applications
    sleep 1
    # switch back configuration
    ln -sf "$CFGFOR" "$CFG"
    i3-msg reload


Both ways have their pros and cons. The first one does not work for every application, but if it works it does so with minimal hassle. The second method works with any application, but it disables all `for_window` configurations for a certain time which may not be desirable. </description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 05:35:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3821/ignore-for_window/?answer=3846#post-id-3846</guid></item></channel></rss>
