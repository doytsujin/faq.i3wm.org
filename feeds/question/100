 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/100/how-can-i-move-a-workspace/?answer=101#post-id-101</link><description>The closes you can get is renaming the workspace with `rename workspace &lt;old_name&gt; to &lt;new_name&gt;` (see [userguide: renaming workspaces](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_renaming_workspaces)). This is equivalent to moving everything there if the workspace doesn't exist yet, but otherwise you can focus parent a bunch of times and move that container.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jun 2012 12:38:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/100/how-can-i-move-a-workspace/?answer=101#post-id-101</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;The closes you can get is renaming the workspace with &lt;code&gt;rename workspace &amp;lt;old_name&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;new_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_renaming_workspaces"&gt;userguide: renaming workspaces&lt;/a&gt;).

This is close, but unfortunately we can not define to which workspace I want to move on the fly, right? By putting this on config, I get stuck with this biding-action.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jun 2012 15:53:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/100/how-can-i-move-a-workspace/?comment=103#comment-103</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Tucos for &lt;p&gt;The closes you can get is renaming the workspace with &lt;code&gt;rename workspace &amp;lt;old_name&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;new_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_renaming_workspaces"&gt;userguide: renaming workspaces&lt;/a&gt;).

Select the master container of the workspace by pressing $mod+a a few times. 

Then throw in your move command.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/100/how-can-i-move-a-workspace/?comment=114#comment-114</link><description>Apparently i just use this occasionally when the main container is tabbed or stacked. 

So, a hacky solution is this. Focus the main container with $mod+a, create a new xterm or whatever next to it, make this layout tabbed. Now you can throw the container around to another workspace. </description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2012 12:07:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/100/how-can-i-move-a-workspace/?comment=114#comment-114</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;I do it like this: &lt;/p&gt;
