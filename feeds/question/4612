I'm working with a dual screen and I would be able to drag a tab from a screen to another.
The problem is when I'm perfoming the action the tab won't go to the other screen. Instead, it creates a new window/workspace in the same screen and I have to move it with the `move workspace to output left/right` keybind. Do you have an idea of what I'm doing wrong?

However, I'm able to move a tab to another screen when it involves it to be put with another one, already in place.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 21:25:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4612/dragging-web-browser-tab-to-another-screen/</guid></item></channel></rss>
