When I open a new dialogue (open/save file, ect.) the focus is shifted to the new floating window as it should.

However when I close the window (say I chose to open a file) the focus stays in 'floating window mode' and switches to the original floating window.

So every time I want to open a file I have to switch the focus back to the tiling again.

Is there a way of configuring i3 in a way that the focus doesn't stay on a floating window if this window is closed?

*EDIT:*

I observe this only when I close a tiling window via a floating dialog-box (e.g. are you sure to close ..). I guess what happens is, the focus wants to jump back to the tiling window it came from, but since this window doesn't exist anymore (since it is closed now as well) it jumps to the next floating window. I think it would feel way more natural, if it jumped back to a tiling window.

Does anyone have an idea how to achieve that?</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 18:13:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6767/automatically-move-focus-back-to-tiling-when-floating-window-is-closed/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Often times I have a floating window on a workspace while the rest of the screen is tiled.

What i3 does is it keeps a list of the order in which you focused windows and if the currently focused window is closed, it falls back to the previously focused window – whether it was floating or tiled doesn't matter.

If you focus a tiled window, open the dialog and it focuses a floating window after the dialog closes, you'll need to provide step by step instructions of what you're doing and with which applications for us to reproduce. With terminals it works as expected for me. </description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 18:25:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6767/automatically-move-focus-back-to-tiling-when-floating-window-is-closed/?answer=6768#post-id-6768</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;No, this shouldn't be the case in the first place.

I'm unsure about this. I will open a report on Github and see what Michael thinks about it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 19:32:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6767/automatically-move-focus-back-to-tiling-when-floating-window-is-closed/?comment=6778#comment-6778</guid></item><item><title>Comment by kyra for &lt;p&gt;No, this shouldn't be the case in the first place.

I will keep an eye open under which circumstances/if it occurs again..
