Your bug report may be closed, since floating windows [aren't intended to be used regularly](https://faq.i3wm.org/django.fcgi/question/772/floating-workspace/?answer=773) in i3. If at all possible, tile the window.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 13:45:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4282#comment-4282</guid></item><item><title>Comment by platz for &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself using floating windows all the time, maybe better use a floating window manager instead ;) &lt;/p&gt;

It seems like a valid question; there will be cases where one may need to re-order these windows.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 16:24:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4284#comment-4284</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself using floating windows all the time, maybe better use a floating window manager instead ;) &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4285#comment-4285</link><description>anoknusa, I think it's the bare minimum to be implemented, when you switch focus in floating mode, that window should be focused "over" all the rest. As it's now, it's really annoying to manage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 18:08:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4285#comment-4285</guid></item><item><title>Comment by tigrezno for &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself using floating windows all the time, maybe better use a floating window manager instead ;) &lt;/p&gt;

This should be implemented IMHO if i3 support floating windows. Focus should bring the window on top, it's obvious.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 11:56:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4279#comment-4279</guid></item><item><title>Comment by joepd for &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself using floating windows all the time, maybe better use a floating window manager instead ;) &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4280#comment-4280</link><description>Now I see what you mean. Floating is always on top, and there seems to be no way to switch focus. Sending the blocking window to the scratchpad is a workaround. But maybe this would count as a bug. </description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 12:03:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4276/bringing-a-floating-window-on-top/?comment=4280#comment-4280</guid></item></channel></rss>
