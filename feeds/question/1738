I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and I've just installed the official i3 package via apt-get.
Since I'm normally using i3 under Arch -where I never had any problems- I'm now confused why I can't move windows to a specific workspace using $mod+Shift+1 or any other number.
I'm using Alt as my Mod-Key and I've already checked any Ubuntu-related hotkeys, but as far as I can see, there aren't any using Alt+Shift. My i3 config file definitely specifies $mod+Shift+&lt;num&gt;, I double checked.

What am I missing?

Furthermore i3bar/i3status doesn't show colored output, eventhough 'colors' is set to true in the .i3status.conf.
(I basically just copied my config files from the Arch partition.)

Would greatly appreciate any help!

&lt;p&gt;I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and I've just installed the official i3 package via apt-get.
Since I'm normally using i3 under Arch -where I never had any problems- I'm now confused why I can't move windows to a specific workspace using $mod+Shift+1 or any other number.
I'm using Alt as my Mod-Key and I've already checked any Ubuntu-related hotkeys, but as far as I can see, there aren't any using Alt+Shift. My i3 config file definitely specifies $mod+Shift+&amp;lt;num&amp;gt;, I double checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;
