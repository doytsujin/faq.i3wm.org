From my subjective impression talking to users, it’s always the windows key.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 19:53:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2847/changing-the-mod-key/?comment=2876#comment-2876</guid></item><item><title>Comment by mcduling for &lt;p&gt;I have my MOD key set up as the Windows key on my keyboard.

So perhaps I'll stick with the Windows key.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2013 08:33:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2847/changing-the-mod-key/?comment=2853#comment-2853</guid></item><item><title>Comment by BatmanAoD for &lt;p&gt;I have my MOD key set up as the Windows key on my keyboard.

While it may be true that "most people" use the Alt key, that doesn't necessarily make it better for **your** workflow. (I personally use the Windows key.)</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 17:29:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2847/changing-the-mod-key/?comment=2849#comment-2849</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;I have my MOD key set up as the Windows key on my keyboard.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2847/changing-the-mod-key/?answer=2848#post-id-2848</link><description>Adjust the $mod variable to Mod1 for using Alt Key.&lt;br/&gt;
The config file can be found under "~/.i3/config".

In my config, I use $sup+&lt;KEY&gt; for program shortcuts.

    # modifier = Alt, $sup = Wind0ws key
    set $mod Mod1
    set $sup Mod4
