Volume control:

And I'll tell you a little secret about software: Power, versatility, low resource usage and a light code base almost never go hand-in-hand with dumbed-down convenience. Automatically mounting external drives is a good example. Any file manager that includes that as a feature is almost certainly going to be part of a desktop environment, or at least will not be any lighter than what you'd find in one from a desktop environment. If you want the lightest file management solution you'll have to do without auto-mounting---unless you're willing to write your own udev rules, or use any of the handful of third-party scripts to automount outside the file manager that are floating around.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 15:41:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4517/desktop-programs-to-use-with-i3/?answer=4519#post-id-4519</guid></item><item><title>Comment by han for &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications"&gt;List of desktop-agnostic applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

`udiskie` is a very nice automounter (with optional tray icon). I highly recommend `ranger` as a file manager, gorgeous software - well worth getting to know. As mentioned it doesn't automount but there's no need to conflate these tasks.


- PDF Reader

Seconding `zathura` (I'm using it with the nice mupdf rendering backend) - contrary to smlx's answer it does have printing etc.

- Network Manager

Check out `connman`. It's fast and light, although I can't recommend a specific frontend, the GTK one is OK but not great.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4517/desktop-programs-to-use-with-i3/?answer=4573#post-id-4573</link><description>I went through a similar process a few years ago when first switching to a tiling WM. Here's what I've settled on:

* file manager with automount support - I use `spacefm-gtk3`; it uses udisks for automount. But `thunar` or `pcmanfm` are also good options (both use gvfs). Also check out `ranger` for a cool CLI file manager (though it doesn't do automount).

* network manager - I just installed `network-manager-gnome`. At some point, if you want the functionality you'll just have to install the dependencies (and the dependencies aren't *too* bad..).

* sound manager - I use `pasystray` - full pulseaudio control from the system tray.

* image viewer - I use `sxiv` - it's the vim of image viewers.

* PDF reader - `zathura` is great to quickly read small documents, but on the occasions that I need the extra features (like print, table of contents), I use `evince`.

There were also some other features I missed from a full DE:

* Clipboard manager - I use `parcellite`.

* Notification daemon. `dunst` is too simple for my liking. For example it doesn't handle multi-head setups well, and custom placement of notifications isn't possible. I use `xfce4-notifyd` instead.

* Power management - very handy for a laptop. I use `xfce4-powermanager`.

Note: I've used the Debian package names, but most should be available in other distros.

In my config on I use:

    # network manager (always runs)
    # (I have no idea why --no-startup-id might be a clever choice, it is used on various websites)
    exec nm-applet

nm-applet is nice since it fits great into my i3bar and does have a nice clickable menu if you want that

#### File Manager with automount

Sorry, never used one.

#### PDF

I like okular, but some friends of mine tell me that mupdf is more "pure unix". There are around 10^10^10 pdfviewer out there, choose one.

#### Sound

Like ANOKNUSA said before it is not hard to create shortcuts for this. I use exactly his lines of code in my configuration file.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 12:26:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4517/desktop-programs-to-use-with-i3/?answer=4564#post-id-4564</guid></item><item><title>Answer by cee for &lt;p&gt;I switched to i3 on one of my machines (Debian testing) after using various traditional desktop environments for years, and I am still lacking alternatives to some auxiliary programs which are shipped with such desktop environments.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4517/desktop-programs-to-use-with-i3/?answer=4567#post-id-4567</link><description>Here are my 2cents:  
I like my computer plain and simple, but I still want all the goodies. ;-)

So here are some of my currently used "desktop" programs  
  
**filemanager**  

&gt; `pcmanfm`  
It's great to acces any samba share with `gvfs-smb`

**network manager**

&gt; `nm-applet`

**sound manager**

    set $psst --no-startup-id
    set $update &amp;&amp; killall -SIGUSR1 i3status
    bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume    exec $psst pactl set-sink-volume 1 -- -5% &amp;&amp; pactl set-sink-mute 1 0 $update
    bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume    exec $psst pactl set-sink-volume 1 -- +5% &amp;&amp; pactl set-sink-mute 1 0 $update
    bindsym XF86AudioMute           exec $psst pactl set-sink-mute 1 toggle $update

Only use the multimedia keys from my notebook.

**image viewer**
&gt; `feh`

**pdf viewer**
&gt; I used to use `apvlv`, no switched to `zathura` and I am very happy with it. Both viewers support vim keybindings, what more could you ask for.
