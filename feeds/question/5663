How is the user supposed to know that you need to use the modifier keys `Mod1` rather than `Alt_L` and `Mod4` rather than `Super_L`?</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 08:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5663/why-are-not-all-key-symbols-recognised-in-i3-config/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings"&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests using &lt;code&gt;xmodmap -pke&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;xev&lt;/code&gt; to figure out key symbols to use with &lt;code&gt;bindsym&lt;/code&gt; in the i3 config.

Running `xmodmap` (without arguments) will display the available modifiers and which keys trigger each modifier.

I don’t think there’s anything we can do in i3 to make this significantly easier, that modifiers exist and how they are configured/how they behave is just something that you’ll have to learn when dealing with X11 :).</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 08:40:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5663/why-are-not-all-key-symbols-recognised-in-i3-config/?answer=5664#post-id-5664</guid></item><item><title>Comment by kynan for &lt;p&gt;Alt+L is a modifier, hence X11 handles it differently than just a regular key.&lt;/p&gt;

The docs do actually mention `xmodmap` so I suppose it's clear enough.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 22:31:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5663/why-are-not-all-key-symbols-recognised-in-i3-config/?comment=5672#comment-5672</guid></item></channel></rss>
