For example, I have an IRC workspace with irssi open and a web workspace with Firefox open and I would like to be able to see both windows by selecting both workspaces, not moving irssi to the web workspace, or vice versa.
Both dwm and awesome are able to do this (awesome is a dwm fork) but they use a kind of tagging system.
Please, say if this is possible and if so, how I could do it.
