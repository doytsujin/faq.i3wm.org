i've concocted the below two bindsym's but they don't seem to work:

bindsym $mod+$alt+Left focus output $monitor_left; workspace prev; focus output $monitor_right; workspace prev

bindsym $mod+$alt+Right focus output $monitor_left; workspace next; focus output 
$monitor_right; workspace next

it just seems that each workspace numerically is iterated through as opposed to changing both on each input.

any ideas what i'm missing here?

    bindsym $mod+$alt+Left focus output left; workspace prev_on_output; focus output right; workspace prev_on_output
    bindsym $mod+$alt+Right focus output left; workspace next_on_output; focus output right; workspace next_on_output
