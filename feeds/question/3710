1. How do I "blink" a workspace? (such as when you open a program in a workspace that doesn't have focus)?
2. Is it possible to find out in which workspace(s) a program is running?

Ultimately, my goal is to set a notification whenever I receive an email. I have offlineimap syncing my email every 5 minutes and mutt running (usually) in workspace 9. So I'd set an offlineimap hook that would call a script that if there was new email, would find out if (and where) mutt is running. If mutt is running, blink that workspace.

Thanks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 21:31:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3710/find-where-program-is-running-and-blink-workspace/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by iomartin for &lt;p&gt;I have two questions in one:&lt;/p&gt;

I hadn't looked into knowing if I have new email, I thought there should be some option in offlineimap/mutt that would allow that.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 13:16:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3710/find-where-program-is-running-and-blink-workspace/?comment=3720#comment-3720</guid></item><item><title>Comment by TonyC for &lt;p&gt;I have two questions in one:&lt;/p&gt;
