The `pactl` commands work in the command line. Re-instating the configs (ctrl+shift+e) does not assign any of the desired keys. I'm looking at the log files shortly, and if I'm worth my salt, I'll get back to this thread (and question) shortly.</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2015 23:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6633/bindings-related-to-pactl-arent-working-in-config/?comment=6643#comment-6643</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I have the standard configuration file (for the most part, I added a script to enable touchpad tap-clicking), and yet my sound does not work.

So first off, you are entirely sure that any other changes to the config file work, right? Just to make sure you're editing the correct file. If so, then what you'll need to do first is give us the config file you're trying to use.</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2015 20:43:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6633/bindings-related-to-pactl-arent-working-in-config/?comment=6641#comment-6641</guid></item><item><title>Comment by saterhater for &lt;p&gt;I have the standard configuration file (for the most part, I added a script to enable touchpad tap-clicking), and yet my sound does not work.

 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6633/bindings-related-to-pactl-arent-working-in-config/?answer=6644#post-id-6644</link><description>I checked out my log file, turns out the commands in the config were firing, they just happened to be wrong (as in, they didn't work at all). I'm not sure why my script to toggle the mute wasn't working, that's a bit messed up. Here's what I did:

I enabled my i3 logs: `i3-msg 'debuglog on; shmlog on; reload'`. Then I watched to see what happens when I used my volume buttons: `watch 'i3-dump-log  | grep pactl'`. I'd then press my volume control buttons, and I'd see the commands being issued. i3 was doing what it was told, *so it must be told to do something that is incorrect*.

Sure enough, the commands I had in the config (`bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume 0 +5%`) *don't do anything*. So I figured out the command that would, in fact, raise and lower my volume (`pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- +5%`), and that did the trick. I feel rather sheepish. Nothing was wrong i3, but the config wasn't quite written for my version of pulse audio.

TLDR: I'm using 4.0.0-kali1-amd64 with i3 v4.8. Just make sure the commands in your config are up to date. I was just being a noob.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 00:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6633/bindings-related-to-pactl-arent-working-in-config/?answer=6644#post-id-6644</guid></item></channel></rss>
