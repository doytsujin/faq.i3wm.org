Using i3 I am still able to enter unicode-characters in the described way, however the underlined 'u' and the input code is not displayed. When using Gnome on the same system (Fedora 19) everything works fine.

Sometimes I would very much prefer to see what I am typing, so my question is, if anyone has experienced this behaviour and has a solution for it or at least can give me some directions where and what to look for.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2013 18:50:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2531/entering-unicode-with-ctrl-shift-u-underlined-u-and-input-not-displayed/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;When entering unicode characters by pressing Ctrl-Shift-U the expected behaviour is, that an underlined 'u' and the following input will be displayed and after pressing Return the unicode-character will appear.&lt;/p&gt;
