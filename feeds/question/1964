 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1964/moving-to-the-last-visited-workspace/?answer=1965#post-id-1965</link><description>In your config, set the option &lt;code&gt;workspace\_auto\_back\_and\_forth yes&lt;/code&gt;. When you are on, say, workspace 1 now and switch to 4 (which is empty), another $mod+4 takes you back to workspace 1. I think this is kind of what you want?</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 08:49:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1964/moving-to-the-last-visited-workspace/?answer=1965#post-id-1965</guid></item><item><title>Comment by killown for &lt;p&gt;In your config, set the option &lt;code&gt;workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes&lt;/code&gt;.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1964/moving-to-the-last-visited-workspace/?comment=1967#comment-1967</link><description>thanks for the reply, but the problem with workspace_auto_back_and_forth is when for example I use  Mod1+Enter it will move to the workspace terminals and open a terminal, and if I use Mod1+Enter one more time it will back to the last visited workspace and the terminal will be opened there .</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 13:22:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1964/moving-to-the-last-visited-workspace/?comment=1967#comment-1967</guid></item><item><title>Comment by vandannen for &lt;p&gt;In your config, set the option &lt;code&gt;workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes&lt;/code&gt;.

</title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1964/moving-to-the-last-visited-workspace/?comment=1969#comment-1969</link><description>in the case of mod+enter, you could still check whether you already are on the "terminals"-workspace before issuing the command to move there.
