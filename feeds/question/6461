 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6461/i3-distro-paring/?answer=6462#post-id-6462</link><description>For me, Arch Linux and i3 is the perfect couple.  
I also used it with xubuntu (XFCE) which worked perfectly. Meanwhile, I prefer my system to be pretty bare therefore I don't feel the need for a whole dektop environment  (just i3 and i3status) .  
Recently I stumbled on [this project](https://github.com/aacebedo/i3-xfce) which seems to streamline the process for useing i3 as a window manager in XFCE. It looks very promising, but I did not try it myself (no XFCE user anymore).</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 05:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6461/i3-distro-paring/?answer=6462#post-id-6462</guid></item><item><title>Answer by oberon for &lt;p&gt;I love the i3 wm.

You can even have it with one of the usual desktop environments.
