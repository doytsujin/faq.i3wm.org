I then noticed certain things were not working, notably tabbed layouts and resizing.

I thought there might be some lines that weren't valid in the version Debian has in its repositories (`4.2-2`;  I was using `4.8-3` in arch), so I restored the default config, but they're not working even then. 

Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening and how I might fix it?  I really don't want to have to use something else, but if its not working, I wouldn't have much choice.  It would be a shame.

Admittedly, I have not tried reinstalling it (I'm at work as of posting this, so I cant try that, ATM).</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:36:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4969/tabbed-layout-and-resize-not-working-in-debian/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by vandannen for &lt;p&gt;Ok, so recently I installed Debian and restored my i3 config.
