To see the difference, open a window, split it horizontally. You will get an indicator on the right side and the next window you open will be placed to the right of the current window. Then open another window, split it vertically. You will get an indicator on the bottom and the next window you open will be placed below the current window.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2012 06:16:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/50/what-about-this-light-blue-line/?answer=51#post-id-51</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Aaron for &lt;p&gt;The indicator indicates where the next window will be placed for a vertically or horizontally split container.&lt;/p&gt;
