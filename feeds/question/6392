I mean to have conky at the right side of the screen in a place which not covered by other windows, as the i3bar does. I tried it but then the opened windows don't take the free space at the left of conky but open at a bottop space about 100px and is visible a very small area of them.

On a similar note, check out this ticket on i3-gaps where someone wants to do the same. I've provided a first draft that makes this setup possible, but haven't yet decided on whether I want to merge it:
