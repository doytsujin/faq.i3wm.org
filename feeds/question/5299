More generally, I wouldn't mind just showing a fixed number of workspaces all the time (say, 4 of them), with no special treatment for those that happen to be empty. Is there a way to accomplish this?

Those who have configured i3 to display workspaces on specific monitors can use -E/--nextempty to go to the first empty workspace with a number higher than the workspace they are currently on.   -- I believe you are looking for something like 'quickswitch -jE' </description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 10:52:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5299/can-i-force-creation-of-new-workspaces-for-move-container-to-workspace-next/?comment=5302#comment-5302</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bosh for &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/OliverUv/quickswitch-for-i3"&gt;https://github.com/OliverUv/quickswit...&lt;/a&gt; (?)&lt;/p&gt;

That's interesting and a good project to know about -- but I don't think it answers my question (unless I'm missing something).  Quote from readme: "-n and -p will only jump to existing workspaces, and if you go beyond the beginning or end of the numbered workspace list, it will wrap". </description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 05:21:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5299/can-i-force-creation-of-new-workspaces-for-move-container-to-workspace-next/?comment=5301#comment-5301</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bosh for &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/OliverUv/quickswitch-for-i3"&gt;https://github.com/OliverUv/quickswit...&lt;/a&gt; (?)&lt;/p&gt;

But this still isn't quite what I'm asking about: I want the next workspace, regardless of whether it's empty. That is to say: create it if it doesn't exist, or use it if it does exist.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 17:47:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5299/can-i-force-creation-of-new-workspaces-for-move-container-to-workspace-next/?comment=5303#comment-5303</guid></item></channel></rss>
