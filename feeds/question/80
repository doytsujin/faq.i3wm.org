I read that we need to "active" the logging, but I did not understand how/where to do it. Do you know where should I place the command for logging (.xsession file did not work, .i3/config did not work):

As for regular logging, your command should be fine and it should be in ~/.xsession if using a display manager and in ~/.xinitrc if using startx.

I got it working by entering into a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and:
/etc/init.d/lightdm stop; startx

The dump is some blob of data that records the state of i3, handy for developers to see what has been leading up to unexpected behavior. This is not intended to be read by mere mortals. 

For the dump-log: i3 needs to be compiled with support for this. This is disabled if you install your package from a repository, as the package is considered stable. 

The exec-line is about starting i3 manually. If you use xinit to launch i3, you should remove 'exec'. This line starts i3 in verbose mode, and sends STDOUT and STDERR to the mentioned file, in stead of cluttering your TTY. 

But it depends on how you launch i3 where you should put such a line. </description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 16:36:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/80/how-to-enable-logs-in-ubuntu/?answer=88#post-id-88</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Please discriminate between a dump-log, and the lines that i3 is printing on STDOUT. &lt;/p&gt;

Also, it does not have to be compiled in, you can enable it in every version. It’s just enabled by default in the developer versions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 21:39:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/80/how-to-enable-logs-in-ubuntu/?comment=89#comment-89</guid></item><item><title>Answer by bruno.braga for &lt;p&gt;I wanted to check out the logs for a crash I could reproduce, but the command gives me:&lt;/p&gt;

So to make it just work properly on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. Create a *.xinitrc* file:

        exec /usr/bin/i3 -V &gt;/tmp/i3-$(date +'%F-%k-%M-%S').log 2&gt;&amp;1


2. Create a symlink for *.xsession*:


        $ ln -s ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession


3. Edit desktop options for lightdm, at: */usr/share/xsessions/i3.desktop*

        [Desktop Entry]
        Name=i3
        Comment=improved dynamic tiling window manager
        Exec=/etc/X11/Xsession
        Type=Application
    

And voila!</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 10:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/80/how-to-enable-logs-in-ubuntu/?answer=1373#post-id-1373</guid></item></channel></rss>
