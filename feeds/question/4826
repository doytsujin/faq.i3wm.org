 - Focus is on left screen, in tabular mode, with three tabed windows opened. Focus in on the lefter tabulation.
 - Jump to workspace 6 (Mod+6) which is on right screen.
 - If I jump left (Mod+Left) focus goes on left monitor, but it focuses the most right tabulation.

I already have a binding to `focus output right`, but I frequently forget to use it.

I would prefer a behavior which says:
When jumping left or right, if it jumps to another monitor, focus on the last focused window on this monitor.

Does this behavior exists?</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 08:33:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4826/focus-on-last-focused-window-when-jump-back-to-monitor/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by lasers for &lt;p&gt;Here the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

The only scenario in which what you want would be useful is when the left-most window on right screen is focused. `back_and_forth` always works the same, no matter where current focus is.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 15:52:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4826/focus-on-last-focused-window-when-jump-back-to-monitor/?comment=4834#comment-4834</guid></item><item><title>Comment by klub for &lt;p&gt;I think you're looking for &lt;code&gt;workspace back_and_forth&lt;/code&gt; when it comes to workspace.

I want to force a focus to a given widow in the output, I don't want to focus to the last output.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 13:22:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4826/focus-on-last-focused-window-when-jump-back-to-monitor/?comment=4831#comment-4831</guid></item></channel></rss>
