&lt;p&gt;Since 4.4 (or 4.5) when I open a link, the browser automatically gets the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How revert this behavior (keep the focus on the current windows)?&lt;/p&gt;

The only way to revert this is to edit the code and remove handling of \_NET\_ACTIVE\_WINDOW event. If the main developer (micheal) agree then I can implement a boolean option for it in the config file.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 15:10:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2020/disable-focus-on-open/?answer=2023#post-id-2023</guid></item><item><title>Comment by sanpi for &lt;p&gt;Commit fa4894f added this feature because some programs want to get focused.

The parameter *browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground* fix this problem.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2013 13:24:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2020/disable-focus-on-open/?comment=2082#comment-2082</guid></item><item><title>Comment by Michael for &lt;p&gt;Commit fa4894f added this feature because some programs want to get focused.

There are other places in i3 where focus gets set (managing a new window) and that should be affected by such a setting, too. Also, it might be worthwhile to make that per-window.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 16:14:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2020/disable-focus-on-open/?comment=2024#comment-2024</guid></item></channel></rss>
