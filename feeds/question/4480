 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4480/swap-windows-in-different-containers/?answer=4520#post-id-4520</link><description>There are two reasons uzbl opens only a single instance per page: To keep the code base simple, and to provide a negative incentive to prevent the mess that results from having too many open browser tabs. The effect you're looking for could be achieved with a single tabbed container instead of a convoluted series of nested containers.

I'm guessing the reason you want this is so you can view the full page title in the titlebar while having lots of open uzbl instances (I can't see any other reason, since you have to cycle through all the windows to swap the two you want anyway). The solution would be to use a single stacked container and not open more browser windows than you need at one time, and use bookmarks for important sites. As it is there's no swap function built into i3, though it's likely possible to achieve one with IPC. Again, though, this would just be extra work aimed at sustaining the bad browsing habits uzbl was designed to curtail.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 16:31:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4480/swap-windows-in-different-containers/?answer=4520#post-id-4520</guid></item></channel></rss>
