&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

There's no such feature in i3. If the application spams urgency hints, file a bug with the application. Urgency is really only for urgency and at the very least they could consider adding an option to disable them altogether. 

One thing you could try, however, is using urgent=latest to react to urgency hints and triggering wmctrl to disable the hint again if it was keepass. This might work, but is a workaround and will likely flash the hint for a brief moment. It would look something like this

    for_window [urgent=latest] exec --no-startup-id wmctrl -r keepass -b remove,demands_attention

You may have to adapt the keepass argument so that it actually matches the window. If keepass uses non-generic names, you will have to extend the script to match the window somehow.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 06:11:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/7085/how-to-disable-urgency-hints-per-application/?answer=7087#post-id-7087</guid></item></channel></rss>
