On the i3bar area (I'm using i3status with it), there is this little black line underneath it. It sits in between the titlebars and the bar itself. I was wondering, is there anyway to get rid of this thing? It's been driving me crazy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2014 00:24:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4663/i3bar-border-cannot-get-rid-of/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by pawelkl for &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

in file `~/.config/i3blocks/config` above any [BLOCK] put:

    separator_block_width=-16
    markup=pango

example:

    separator_block_width=-16
    markup=pango
    [SOME_BLOCK]
    full_text=&lt;span bgcolor='#ff0000' &gt;LOL&lt;/span&gt;

some blocks are too short then - so I put spaces at the end of `full_text` (after `&lt;/span&gt;`!)

value `-16` probably You need to corelate with i3bar font size (`bar` section in ~/.config/i3/config )

You can also use normal i3status and then put two needed lines in every block so it could be "borderless"</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 18:42:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/4663/i3bar-border-cannot-get-rid-of/?answer=6489#post-id-6489</guid></item></channel></rss>
