I'm working with i3 just for a few days. I've asked myself if there's a possibility to visually distinguish if a window is currently in splith or splitv layout mode? For example for me it would be just fine if I could control it by manipulating the window title in form of adding an "H" or "V" or any kind of color hints.

I've been finding no answer in the user guide. I'm not sure if that can be done by i3-msg or dirty config manipulating and reloading.

Any ideas?</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 14:40:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/626/layout-hint-in-window-title/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Michael for &lt;p&gt;hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

For non-nested containers you can see if the window is split (and in which direction) by paying attention to the window borders: the bottom (or right) side is highlighted in a slightly different color, the "indicator" color.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 14:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/626/layout-hint-in-window-title/?answer=627#post-id-627</guid></item><item><title>Comment by i3-tiler for &lt;p&gt;This is already done in the recent git versions of i3, but only if the window is nested within a stacked/tabbed container.&lt;/p&gt;

thanks. that did it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/626/layout-hint-in-window-title/?comment=629#comment-629</guid></item><item><title>Answer by i3-tiler for &lt;p&gt;hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
