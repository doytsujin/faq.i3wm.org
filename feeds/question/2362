I wonder is it possible to do such thing in i3: to point i3 how many windows I want to have in one row. And then when this is reached, i3 starts with new row :) I.e. I want matrix 4x4, so I open 16 terminals and they are automatically line up. Of course, I can do it manually by switching between vert/horiz layouts for every window but it would be great to do it automatically :)
