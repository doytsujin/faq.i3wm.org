A lot of people use urxvt (also known as rxvt-unicode), I don't use a lightweight terminal emulator, but I use gnome-terminal. If you want really lightweight, but not very configurable, you could use st, which is part of the suckless-tools package (dmenu is part of the package as well) which is installed as one of the dependencies of i3.

By default, the terminal launched by $mod+Return, is whatever is defined by the i3-sensible-terminal command. If you look at the man page for i3-sensible-terminal, you will see that it launches whichever program is defined by $TERMINAL, if that is not defined, it falls back on x-terminal-emulator, then goes down a list if that is not defined. If you do not wish to define $TERMINAL in your shell config, and you are on a debian-based system (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux-Mint, etc), you can define which program is launched by x-terminal-emulator by running the command: update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 14:09:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2442/what-terminal-would-you-reccomend-and-how-to-set-it-as-default/?answer=2443#post-id-2443</guid></item></channel></rss>
