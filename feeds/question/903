I have an Nvidia GTS 450 graphics card, with the Nvidia driver version 310.19. I've also set up the following attributes in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`:

    Option         "Composite" "Disable"
    Option         "TrippleBuffering"    "true"
    Option         "DynamicTwinView"     "false"
    Option         "UseEvents"           "true"
    Option         "FlatPanelProperties" "Scaling = Native"

While this may not be an issue with i3, I was wondering if there was something that could be done in order to wait for all the windows to be rendered in a workspace before switching to it so that no more tearing will appear. This seems to occur also with the Nouveau driver.

Later Edit:

Tearing does not occur when using `xterm` or `urxvt`, however. It seems that this happens on `xfce4-terminal` and `gnome-terminal`, therefore a possible solution will be to change the terminal emulator. I guess I answered my own question.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 20:10:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/903/workspace-switching-causes-screen-tearing/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by AladW for &lt;p&gt;Considering I have a terminal occupying a whole workspace and another terminal in another, switching quickly between these two workspaces will cause screen tearing with some white rectangles "blending in" with the terminal background color.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never once heard of a problem with Intel graphic cards, so I recommend these.

I am not aware of anything we can do in i3 to fix this from our side, but that doesn’t mean that there is nothing we can do…</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 20:22:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/903/workspace-switching-causes-screen-tearing/?answer=905#post-id-905</guid></item><item><title>Comment by aliasbind for &lt;p&gt;In my experience, any form of tearing/lags/corruption occuring in i3 was caused by faulty graphic drivers and/or graphics hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that there is no tearing with most applications that I tried until now, except for those two given in my post above (`gnome-terminal` and `xfce4-terminal`).</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 20:47:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/903/workspace-switching-causes-screen-tearing/?comment=906#comment-906</guid></item></channel></rss>
