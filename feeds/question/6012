For instance I like the idea to have workspaces that can be displayed on both outputs.
To to that, I use the i3-wk-switcher, which does almost what I want (https://travisf.net/i3-wk-switcher/).
Now I would like to have only 1 bar, on my main output.
I use output SCREEN1, but the workspace button list only contains the workspace of this screen.
How could I list all active workspaces?</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 16:44:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6012/display-all-active-workspaces/</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;I have just migrated from xmonad, and I would like to keep some behaviors I was used to.
