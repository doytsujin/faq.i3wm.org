Windows Vista had this feature called sidebar. I wanna configure conky/gkrellm/... to be sidebar - unmovable window on the right of my screen. This should be shown with containers - not covering (as floating window) nor on the desktop (part of wallpaper, covered by containers).

What I want: (window and sidebar don't cover each other, also sidebar is unmovable - not act as normal container - ie. ability to move, change size...)
