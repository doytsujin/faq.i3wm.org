Loving i3.

Currently using a triple monitor setup at home. 

Common usage is monitor 1 -&gt; firefox, 2 -&gt; emacs, 3 -&gt; terminal 

Although i have set 

    focus_follows_mouse no

When I click on the terminal after leaving a window the terminal doesn't receive keyboard focus (or even appear to have focus at all, it is still dimmed) and typing continues in emacs or firefox  or wherever it was.

The exact same problem occurs whichever window I am going from or to.

My habit has become to reload my config because for the first click focus is achieved as expected.

This is particularly annoying when a popup window needs to be cleared and I have to reload the config and then goto the mouse and ... 

Moving focus using $mod + 1 etc works as expected.

Please help and advise where this question falls short and I will try to improve it by adding detail, clarity where requested etc. 

Thank-you.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 12:02:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5894/clicking-a-window-doesnt-move-focus/</guid></item><item><title>Comment by airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hi newb here,&lt;/p&gt;

Don't forget a log file (best would be to restart i3 right before clicking on a window once and typing a little and then take the log right away, that way the file stays small). Also make sure you're on the latest version of i3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 06:57:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/5894/clicking-a-window-doesnt-move-focus/?comment=5897#comment-5897</guid></item><item><title>Comment by bluekeys for &lt;p&gt;Hi newb here,&lt;/p&gt;
