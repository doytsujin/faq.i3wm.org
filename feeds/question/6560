 </title><link>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6560/padding-between-system-tray-icons/?answer=6574#post-id-6574</link><description>There is the `tray_padding` config directive for the `bar` block. However, this is currently only available in the development branch and will be part of the i3 4.11 release. So either you compile the dev branch or wait for that release.

Note that this directive changes the padding all around tray icons, so also above and below them.</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2015 09:09:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://faq.i3wm.org/question/6560/padding-between-system-tray-icons/?answer=6574#post-id-6574</guid></item><item><title>Answer by Airblader for &lt;p&gt;Hello, Is it posible to add padding between the system tray icons?
